How r/vexillogycirclejerk would describe this flag:

- Flag of Åland Islands if it was actually the flag of Shetland but with a stronger blue.
- Flag of Åland Islands but it is actually the unofficial national flag of Iceland (the Hvítbláinn) in use by Icelandic nationalist activists from 1897 until 1915 but with a stronger blue.
- Flag of Åland Islands but it is actually the flag of Sweden but I didn't pee on the cross and with a stronger blue.

(Also what the fuck is a Scandinavian cross, that's "set towards the left side of the flag" and "equidistant from all sides"???)
