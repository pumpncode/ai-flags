The flag of Nicaragua is made up of three equal horizontal stripes of alternating blue and white, all three running the full length of the flag with a centered coat of arms. The coat of arms consists of a central triangle which divides two semicircles, the top of which is blue, and the bottom of which is white. In the center of the triangle is a volcano, and the borders of the triangle are red and from it emerges a rainbow. The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3.
