The flag of Cook Islands comprises a flag ratio of 10:19. Its design consists of a blue field with the flag of the United Kingdom - i.e. a defaced Union flag - in the upper hoist-side quadrant and a large red circle next to it in the fly half. The red circle stands for the union between the islands and four small white five-pointed stars inside it symbolizing the 15 islands of the archipelago.
