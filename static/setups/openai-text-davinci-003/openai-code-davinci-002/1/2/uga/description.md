The flag of Uganda consists of six horizontal stripes, alternating between black and yellow, each stripe one-sixth the height of the flag. In the center is a white circle, slightly to the hoist side of center, its diameter equal to the height of the flag. Inside the circle is a red, six-pointed, starred disc, the points of the stars touching the edge of the circle.
