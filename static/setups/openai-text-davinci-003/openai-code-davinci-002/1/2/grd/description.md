The flag of Grenada is a 4 by 5 ratio divided horizontally into two equal parts - the upper part red and the lower part yellow. The center of the red portion is emblazoned with a nutmeg in a circle of yellow and against a backdrop of two tropical branches in green and yellow. On the left of the nutmeg is a yellow inverted "isosceles triangle" pointing downward. On the right of the nutmeg is an upward-pointing red "isosceles triangle".
