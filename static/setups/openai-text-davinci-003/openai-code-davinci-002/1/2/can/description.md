The flag of Canada is a two-dimensional flag with a ratio of two by length to one by width. It is composed of two vertical red rectangles, each one a third of the flag's height, bordered by a white square in the centre. The red rectangles are separated by a single narrow red stripe that is half the width of the rectangles. The red, white, and red are symmetrical both horizontally and vertically. The national symbol of Canada, a 11-point red maple leaf, is centered in the white square. The flag has no other adornments.
