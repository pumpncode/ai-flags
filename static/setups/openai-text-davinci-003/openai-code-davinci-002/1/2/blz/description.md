The Belize flag has a royal blue field with a white disc in the center. The disc has a simplified Belizean coat of arms arranged within it, consisting of a red and white shield, flanked by a wood cutting axe and a garroted sarape, all in black, surmounted by a mahogany tree and log in natural colors. The red banner beneath the shield contains the national motto "Sub Umbra Floreo", meaning "I flourish in the shade". The flag has an aspect ratio of 1:2.
