The flag of Bangladesh consists of a dark green field with a red equilateral triangle at the hoist, pointing towards the centre of the flag. The sides of the triangle are approximately one-third of the total length of the flag. Inside the triangle a white circle filled with a red disc occupies nearly half of the triangular area. The red disc contains a green shape in the form of a map of Bangladesh.
