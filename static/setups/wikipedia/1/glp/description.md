# Flag of Guadeloupe

Guadeloupe, an overseas region and department of France located in the Caribbean, has no flag with official status other than the French national flag.

## Other flags

The French *tricolore* is the official national flag used in Guadeloupe.

In addition to the French flag, an inscribed regional logo on a white field is often used as regional flag, similar to the practice in Mayotte and RÃ©union. The logo of Guadeloupe shows a stylized Sun and bird on a green and light blue square with the subscript *REGION GUADELOUPE* underlined in yellow.

A locally used unofficial flag, based on the coat of arms of Guadeloupe's capital Basse-Terre has a black or red field with a 30-rayed yellow sun and a green sugarcane, and a blue stripe with three yellow fleurs-de-lis on the top.

The independentist People's Union for the Liberation of Guadeloupe has proposed a national flag very similar to that of Suriname.
