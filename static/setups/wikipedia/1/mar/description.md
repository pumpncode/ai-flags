# Flag of Morocco

The flag of Morocco (Arabic: علم المغرب) is the flag used by the government of Morocco and has served as the national flag of Morocco since 17 November 1915. It has a red field with a green star in the centre. The green star represents the five pillars of Islam, and the red represents the blood of the ancestors and unity.

Red has considerable historic significance in Morocco by proclaiming the descent from the royal 'Alawid dynasty. The ruling house was associated with the Islamic prophet Muhammad via Fatimah, the wife of Ali, the fourth Muslim Caliph. Red is also the colour that was used by the sharifs of Mecca and the imams of Yemen. Since the 17th century, Morocco is ruled by the 'Alawid dynasty, and the first flags of the country were plain red.

On 17 November 1915, Sultan Yusef signed a dhahir that made Morocco's flag red with a green interlaced pentangle.

While Morocco was under French and Spanish control, the red flag with the seal in the centre remained in use but only inland since its use at sea was prohibited. When independence was restored in 1955, it once again became the national flag.

The pentagram represents the Seal of Solomon, an Islamic symbol. The five branches also represent the pillars of Islam.

## History

In the 17th century, when Morocco became ruled by the current 'Alawid dynasty, its flag was solid red at first. The Sharifs of Makkah used that as a reference colour.

> To be known from this book, may God uphold its value and to be around the centre of grace and joy its orbit, that due to the promotion of our Sherifian Kingdom affairs, the spread of its glory and its pride, the need to assign a flag that distinct it from the rest of the kingdoms as that our sacred ancestors flag use to be very similar to some other flags especially the ones used in the marine signs, our noble vision decided to distinct our joyful flag by making the five-pointed seal of Solomon in the middle in green, asking the almighty god to keep it waving with the winds of fortune and ambition for this time and the becoming, Amen and peace.
