# Flag of Guam

The flag of the United States territory of Guam was adopted on February 9, 1948. The territorial flag is dark blue with a narrow red border on all sides (border was a later addition). The red border represents the blood spilled in World War II and Spanish sovereignty. In the center of the flag is the seal; an almond-shaped emblem, which depicts a proa sailing in Hagåtña Bay near Hagåtña, and *GUAM* colored in red letters. The shape of the emblem recalls the slingshot stones used by ancient Chamorro people. The landform in the background depicts the Two Lovers Point cliff on Guam. Charles Alan Pownall, the military Governor of Guam, approved the flag's shape in 1948.

As a complement to the Guam flag design, and in response to Guam law providing for municipal flags, efforts were made to depict the culture of each Guam municipality on their own flag. These efforts to design 19 unique municipal flags were collaborated through the Mayors' Council with the assistance of illustrative artist Gerard Aflague, a Guam born native. These municipal flag designs reflect unique aspects of each of Guam's municipal villages.
