# Flag of Cocos (Keeling) Islands

The flag of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands was created in 2003 and adopted on 6 April 2004. It was designed by territory resident Mohammed Minkom, who won a design contest as a teenager.

## Design

The flag consists of a green field, with a palm tree on a gold disc in the canton, a gold crescent moon in the centre of the flag and a gold southern cross in the fly. The palm tree represents the islands' tropical flora; the colours are Australia's national colours; the crescent represents Islam, the religion of the Cocos Malays who make up a majority of the islands' population; and the Southern Cross is a symbol of Australia and the Southern Hemisphere.
