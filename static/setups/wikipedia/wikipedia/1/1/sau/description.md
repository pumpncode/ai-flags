# Flag of Saudi Arabia

The flag of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Arabic: علم المملكة العربية السعودية) is the flag used by the government of Saudi Arabia since 15 March 1973. It is a green flag featuring in white an Arabic inscription and a sword. The inscription is the Islamic creed, or *shahada*: "There is no deity but God; Muhammad is the Messenger of God".

## Design

The Arabic inscription on the flag, written in the calligraphic Thuluth script, is the *shahada* or Islamic declaration of faith:

- - لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا الله مُحَمَّدٌ رَسُولُ الله
  - **
  - *"There is no deity but God; Muhammad is the Messenger of God."*

The green of the flag represents Islam and the sword stands for the strictness in applying justice.

The flag is manufactured with identical obverse and reverse sides, to ensure the *shahada* reads correctly, from right to left, from either side. The sword also points to the left on both sides, in the direction of the script. The flag is sinister hoisted, meaning that when viewed from the obverse (front) side, it is hoisted to the left of the flagpole.

The usual color of the flag's green was approximated by Album des pavillons as Pantone 330 C, while the color used on flags at United Nations is approximately Pantone 349. At the 2012 London Olympics, Pantone 355 was used.

## Use

Because the *shahada* is considered holy, the flag is not normally used on T-shirts or other items. Saudi Arabia protested against its inclusion on a planned football to be issued by FIFA, bearing all the flags of the participants of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Saudi officials said that kicking the creed with the foot was completely unacceptable. Similarly, an attempt by the U.S. military to win favour with children of the Khost Province of Afghanistan by distributing footballs adorned with flags, including that of Saudi Arabia, ended in demonstrations.

The flag is never lowered to half-mast as a sign of mourning, because lowering it would be considered blasphemous.<!-- deleted flagspot reference because it cites the bbc article as its own source --> Similarly, the flags of Afghanistan, Iraq and self-declared Somaliland are also never at half-mast.

The normal flag cannot be hoisted vertically according to Saudi legislation. Special vertical flags are manufactured where both the inscription (the creed) and the emblem (the sword) are rotated, although this is rare, as most Arab countries traditionally do not hoist flags vertically.

## History

The precursor states to Saudi Arabia were Nejd and Hejaz. The state flag of Nejd followed today's Saudi flag pattern very closely. The state of Hejaz followed the patterns seen in countries like Palestine and Sudan. Caliphates such as the Rashiduns, the Umayyads and the Abbasids used other flags with only one color. After the Sack of Baghdad in 1258 by the Mongols, the primary caliphate became the Mamluk Sultanate. In 1517, the Ottomans invaded Egypt and inherited Hejaz and ruled it until the Great Arab Revolt of 1916. From 1902 until 1921 a different Arabic inscription was used. One of the primary opponents to the Saudis was the Emirate of Jabal Shammar of the Al Rashid family in the north of the peninsula, until their defeat in 1921.

The Al Saud, the ruling family of Saudi Arabia, has long been closely related with Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. He and the people who followed him, since the 18th century, had used the *shahada* on their flags. In 1921, Abdulaziz Abdulrahman Al-Saud, leader of the Al Saud and the future founder of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, added a sword to this flag. The design of the flag was not standardized prior to March 15, 1973, and variants with two swords and/or a white vertical stripe at the hoist were frequently used. By 1938, the flag had basically assumed its present form, except the sword had a different design (with a more curved blade) and it, along with the *shahada* above, took up more of the flag's space.

-  Flag of Saudi Arabia from 1932 to 1934, with white stripe on the hoist

-  Flag of Saudi Arabia from 1934 to 1938, with a thinner white stripe

-  Flag of Saudi Arabia from 1938 to 1973, with no stripe
