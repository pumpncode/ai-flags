  Naval jack of Latvia. Ratio: 2:3

The national flag of Latvia (Latvian: *Latvijas karogs*) was used by independent Latvia from 1918 until the country was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940. Its use was suppressed during Soviet rule. On 27 February 1990, shortly before the country regained its independence, the Latvian government re-adopted the traditional red-white-red flag.

Though officially adopted in 1921, the Latvian flag was in use as early as the 13th century. The red colour is sometimes described as symbolizing the readiness of the Latvians to give the blood from their hearts for freedom and their willingness to defend their sovereignty. An alternative interpretation, according to the *Rhymed Chronicle of Livonia*, is that a Latgalian leader was wounded in battle, and the edges of the white sheet in which he was wrapped were stained by his blood with the centre stripe of the flag being left unstained. This story is similar to the legend of the origins of the flag of Austria.

## History

The red-white-red Latvian flag (German: *die Banier der Letten*) is first mentioned in the medieval *Rhymed Chronicle of Livonia* (*Livländische Reimchronik*), which covers the period from 1180 to 1343, and is thus among the oldest flags in the world. The chronicle tells of a battle that took place around 1279, in which ancient Latgalian tribes from Cēsis, a city in the northern part of modern-day Latvia, went to war, bearing a red flag with a white stripe.

Legend recounts the story of the mortally wounded chief of Latgalians who was wrapped in a white sheet. The part of the sheet on which he was lying remained white, but the two edges were stained in his blood. During the next battle the bloodstained sheet was used as a flag. According to the legend this time the Latgalian warriors were successful and drove the enemy away. Ever since then Latgalian tribes have used these colours.

Based on the aforementioned historical record, the present day flag design was adapted by artist Ansis Cīrulis lv; ru in May 1917. The Latvian national flag, together with the national coat of arms was affirmed in this format by a special parliamentary decree of the Republic of Latvia passed on 15 June 1921.

### Occupation

Main article: Flag of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic

A variation appeared in Anti-Soviet demonstrations.

During the Soviet period by the Soviet Union (and briefly during occupation by Nazi Germany), the red-white-red Latvian flag was rendered unusable from 1940 to 1941 and 1944 to 1991. Any production and public display of the nationalist Latvian flag was considered anti-state crime and punishable by law. The first flag of Soviet Latvia was a red flag with the gold hammer and sickle in the top-left corner, with the Latin characters LPSR (*Latvijas Padomju Sociālistiskā Republika*) above them in gold in a serif font. In 1953, the final version of the flag was adopted. It depicts the Soviet flag with six 1/3 blue wavy bands representing the sea on the bottom.

### Restoration

Under the influence of Mikhail Gorbachev's *glasnost* and *perestroika* initiatives, the flag of independent Latvia was restored on 15 February 1990, one and a half years before the formal recognition of Latvian independence.

## Colours and proportions

Per Latvian law *The Latvian national flag is carmine red with white horizontal stripe.* (Latvian: *tumši sarkana (karmin)*) The colour on the flag is sometimes referred to as *Latvian red*. The red colour of the Latvian flag is a particularly dark shade, which is composed of brown and purple. The flag's colour proportions are 2:1:2 (the upper and lower red bands each being twice as wide as the central white band), and the ratio of the height of the flag to its width is fixed at 1:2.
