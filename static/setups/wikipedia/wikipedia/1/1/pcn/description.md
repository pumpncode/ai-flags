# Flag of Pitcairn Islands

The coat of arms of the Pitcairn Islands is an official emblem of the British Overseas Territory of the Pitcairn Islands, alongside the flag of the Pitcairn Islands, and was granted by royal warrant on 4 November 1969. The flag, which consists of a Blue Ensign displaying the coat of arms, was granted on 2 April 1984.

## Coat of arms

The coat of arms features several symbols relevant to the ancestral history and culture of the Pitcairn Islanders, most of whom are descended from the sailors who mutinied on HMS *Bounty* in 1789: the blue, yellow and green of the shield symbolise the island of Pitcairn rising from the Pacific Ocean, while the anchor and Bible are symbols of the *Bounty*. Additionally, the Bible symbolises Christianity, which the mutineers brought to the island. The shield is surrounded by a green and gold wreath, and crested by a helmet bearing a wheelbarrow and a slip of miro, a local tree, which represent the role agriculture played in helping the mutineers survive on the island. The slip of miro also represents the wood used by Pitcairn Islanders for crafting souvenirs.

## Flag

The Pitcairn flag features a Blue Ensign with the Pitcairn coat of arms defaced on the fly. The design was suggested by the Island Council in December 1980 and approved on 2 April 1984. It was first flown in May 1984, during a visit by the then-governor Sir Richard Stratton.
