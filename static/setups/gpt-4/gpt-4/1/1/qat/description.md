The flag of Qatar consists of two main colors: maroon (#8C1D40) and white. It has an aspect ratio of 11:28, making it one of the few flags with a greater length than the standard 1:2 ratio.

The flag features a white vertical band on the hoist side which takes up approximately 1/3 of the flag's width. This white stripe is followed by a larger maroon field that covers the remaining 2/3 of the flag's width. Separating the white and maroon fields is a zigzag pattern comprised of nine white serrated (or triangular) points, with five pointing towards the fly end and four towards the hoist side.

There are no set measurements for the geometric properties, as they can be scaled accordingly while maintaining the aspect ratio and relative proportions of the design elements.
