Geometric properties and measurements:
1. The total width of the flag is divided into 16 parts.
2. The maroon field occupies 12 parts out of the 16 parts of the entire width.
3. The yellow border surrounding the maroon field is 1/16th of the flag's width.
4. The green stripe (on the left) is 2 parts out of the 16 parts of the flag's width.
5. The orange stripe (adjacent to the green stripe) is 1 part out of the 16 parts of the flag's width.
6. The height of the lion is 8/9ths of the maroon field height, centered in the field.
