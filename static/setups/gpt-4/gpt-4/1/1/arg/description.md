The flag of Argentina consists of three horizontal stripes: the top and bottom are light blue (#75AADD) and the middle is white (#FFFFFF). In the center of the white stripe is a golden-yellow sun (Inca Sun, #FAB616) with 32 rays. The aspect ratio is 9:14.

The geometric properties of the flag include:
1. The height of each stripe is one-third of the flag's height.
2. The distance of the sun from the top and bottom edges is half the height of the blue stripe.
3. The diameter of the sun is equal to the height of the white stripe.
4. The face on the sun is centered, and its diameter equals 0.8 the diameter of the sun.

No specific measurements are provided, as flags can be made in different sizes, but the proportions should be maintained according to the aspect ratio and geometrics mentioned above.
