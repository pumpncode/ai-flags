The flag of Liechtenstein has an aspect ratio of 3:5, meaning it is 3 units tall and 5 units wide. It consists of two horizontal bands of equal height. The top band is blue (color code: #00247D), and the bottom band is red (color code: #CF142B). On the left side of the flag, in the upper blue stripe and towards the hoist, there is a golden-yellow crown (color code: #DDB211) that represents the Principality of Liechtenstein. The exact geometric properties and measurements of the crown may vary depending on the specific depiction, but it is typically centered vertically within the blue stripe, with adequate space surrounding it.
