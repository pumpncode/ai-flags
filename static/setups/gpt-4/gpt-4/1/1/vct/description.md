The flag of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has an aspect ratio of 3:5, featuring three vertical bands of blue (#003EFF), gold (double-diamond pattern, #FFCD00) and green (#009E60). The gold band is 1/2 the width of the flag, while blue and green bands are each 1/4 the width. In the center of the gold band, there are three diamonds arranged in a V shape. Each diamond is constructed from two equilateral triangles with side lengths equal to 1/24 the flag's width. The two lower diamonds share a common side; their bases are parallel and separated by 1/72 the flag's width. The upper diamond's apex touches the base midpoint of the other two diamonds, forming an equilateral triangle between the three diamond centers.
