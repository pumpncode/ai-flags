The flag of Kyrgyzstan has an aspect ratio of 3:5. It features a red field with a yellow emblem in the center. The emblem consists of a sun with 40 rays and crossed stylized representations of a "tunduk," the circular opening at the top of a traditional Kyrgyz yurt.

Colors:
- Red (Pantone 186 C): HEX #C60C30, RGB (198, 12, 48)
- Yellow (Pantone 116 C): HEX #FFCD00, RGB (255, 205, 0)

Geometric Properties:
1. The sun has a diameter equal to 3/5 of the flag's height.
2. The sun is surrounded by 40 evenly spaced rays, which are divided into two types: 20 curved rays and 20 straight rays. The rays alternate between curved and straight.
3. The tunduk's outer circle (crossed lines) has a diameter of 1/2 of the sun's diameter.
4. The tunduk's inner circle (crossed lines) has a diameter of 1/4 of the sun's diameter.
5. The distance between the tips of the tunduk's outer crossed lines equals the sun's diameter.

Measurements:
Assuming the flag's height (H) is 3 units and width (W) is 5 units:

1. Sun diameter: 3/5 H
2. Tunduk outer circle diameter: 3/10 H
3. Tunduk inner circle diameter: 3/20 H
