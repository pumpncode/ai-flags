The flag of Hong Kong features a red field with a white, stylized, five-petal Bauhinia blakeana flower at the center. The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, which means its length is twice its width.

- Red: #DE2910
- White: #FFFFFF

Geometric properties:
- Each petal contains one red, five-pointed star towards the flower's center.
- The stars are arranged in an "X" formation within the petals, with one point facing outward.
- The stars' outer edges form a circle centered on the middle star.

Measurements:
- Diameter of the circle formed by the stars: approximately half the width of the flag.
- Diameter of each star: roughly 1/10th the width of the flag.
- Distance between the center of the circle and each star's center: around 1/16th the width of the flag.
- Angle between the lines connecting the center of the circle to the centers of adjacent stars: 72 degrees.

These dimensions may vary slightly depending on the specific flag manufacturer or rendering.
