The flag of Yemen consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width. From top to bottom, the colors are red (#FF0000), white (#FFFFFF), and black (#000000). The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning its width is two-thirds of its length. There isn't any specific geometric pattern or emblem on the flag other than the horizontal stripes.
