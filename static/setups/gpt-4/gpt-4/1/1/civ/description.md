The flag of Ivory Coast consists of three vertical stripes of equal width. The colors are orange (#F77F00), white (#FFFFFF), and green (#009E60), from left to right. Its aspect ratio is 2:3, meaning it is twice as long as it is tall. Due to the simplicity of its design, there are no specific geometric properties or measurements beyond the equal-width stripes and overall aspect ratio.
