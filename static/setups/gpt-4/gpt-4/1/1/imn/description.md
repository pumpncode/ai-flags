The flag of the Isle of Man, also known as the Manx flag, consists of a red field with a gold triskelion featuring three armored legs with golden spurs, arranged in a clockwise direction at the center. The color codes for the flag are:

- Red: Pantone 186 C; Hex #C8102E; RGB (200, 16, 46)
- Gold: Pantone 1235 C; Hex #FFB81C; RGB (255, 184, 28)

The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning its width is twice its height. Geometrically, the triskelion comprises three equilateral triangles joined together at their vertices, forming a larger triangle, with each leg extending from one of the triangle's outer corners. Each leg is bent at the knee to give the appearance of running.

There aren't any specific measurements for the flag, but standard practice is to use dimensions that maintain the aspect ratio (e.g., 3 feet by 6 feet, or 90 centimeters by 180 centimeters).

Beyond these basic specifications, there isn't much more information needed to accurately describe the flag without delving into symbolism.
