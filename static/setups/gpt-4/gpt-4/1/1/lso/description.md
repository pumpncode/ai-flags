The flag of Lesotho has the following properties:

1. Aspect ratio: 2:3
2. Colors and color codes:
   - Blue (#003399)
   - White (#FFFFFF)
   - Green (#009900)
   - Black (#000000)

The flag consists of three horizontal stripes in blue, white, and green, with proportions of 3:4:3 (height-wise). A black Basotho hat, also known as "mokorotlo", is centered on the white stripe.

I cannot provide precise geometric measurements for the Basotho hat, but it's important to note that it's centered within the white band and sized so as to remain visually balanced with the other elements of the flag.
