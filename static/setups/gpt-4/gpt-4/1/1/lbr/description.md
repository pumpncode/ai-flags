2. The blue square has a width equal to 7 stripes (or 7/11ths of the flag's height).
3. The white star's diameter is 4/5ths the width of the blue square.
4. The distance from the center of the star to the top and bottom edges of the blue square is half the width of the square.
5. The distance from the center of the star to the side edges of the blue square is two-thirds of the square's width.
