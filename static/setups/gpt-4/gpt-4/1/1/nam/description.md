The flag of Namibia has an aspect ratio of 3:2. It consists of five main elements:

1. A red diagonal stripe with PANTONE 186 C (#C8102E) color, running from the lower hoist-side corner to the upper fly-side corner.
2. A white border surrounding the red stripe with a width of 1/30th of the length of the flag.
3. A blue field (PANTONE 286 C, #0033A0) above the white-bordered red stripe, covering the upper hoist-side corner.
4. A green field (PANTONE 348 C, #009E60) below the white-bordered red stripe, filling the lower fly-side corner.
5. A gold sun with 12 triangular rays in the top hoist-side corner (PANTONE 1235 C, #FFB81C).

Each color field is divided by the diagonal stripe, resulting in triangles formed by the intersecting points of the stripe and the flag edges:

- The blue triangle's two shorter sides both measure 3/8 of the flag's length.
- The green triangle's two shorter sides are also 3/8 of the flag's length.

The sun's diameter is 1/3 of the flag's width and is centered in the blue field, with its outer edge touching the white-bordered red stripe.
