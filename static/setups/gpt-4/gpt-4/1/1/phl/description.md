The flag of the Philippines has an aspect ratio of 1:2. It is horizontally divided into two equal bands, with royal blue (#0038A8) on top and scarlet red (#CE1126) at the bottom. On the left side, there is a white equilateral triangle (based on the hoist side) that contains a golden-yellow sun with eight primary rays, each containing three individual rays, plus three five-pointed stars at each vertex of the triangle. The colors are specified using Pantone codesâ€”286 C for blue, 186 C for red, and 116 C for yellow.

The width of the triangle's base is equal to half the flag's width, while its height is equal to the flag's entire height. The sun's diameter is 3/8 of the triangle's height, and it is centered inside the triangle. Each star has an outer diameter of 3/10 the height of the triangle, and their distance from the vertices is 1/14 of the flag's length, measured from the imaginary intersections of the two lines that bisects the angle formed by the star and triangle's vertices.
