The flag of Cambodia consists of three horizontal stripes and a depiction of Angkor Wat in the center. The top and bottom stripes are blue (#003F87), each occupying 1/4th of the flag's height. The middle stripe is red (#DE2910), occupying 1/2 of the flag's height.

The aspect ratio of the Cambodian flag is 2:3, meaning it is twice as long as it is tall (for example, 100cm x 150cm). Angkor Wat, depicted in white (#FFFFFF), is situated in the center of the middle red stripe.

Geometrically, the flag can be divided into four horizontal stripes of equal height, with blue on the top and bottom, and red in the middle two sections. The Angkor Wat emblem can be inscribed within an imaginary rectangle whose width is 6/15th of the flag length and height is 2/3rd of the flag height, centered vertically and horizontally.

No official measurements or specifications have been provided for the depiction of Angkor Wat on the flag.
