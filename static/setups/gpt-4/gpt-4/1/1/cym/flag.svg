2. Create the blue background using the Pantone 280 C color (#00247D):

```xml
	<path fill="#00247D" d="M0 0h2000v1000H0z"/>
	```

3. Add the Union Jack as a quarter of the flag's width:

```xml
	```

Note: The Union Jack is quite complex to include in this response. You could find an SVG version of it online or refer to this Wikipedia page for detailed instructions on how to draw it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom#Construction

4. Add the white disc with a diameter equal to half the width of the blue field (which is 375 units in the given viewBox settings):

```xml
	<circle cx="1375" cy="500" r="375" fill="#FFF"/>
	```

5. Include the coat of arms on the white disc:

```xml
	```

Creating an accurate SVG representation of the Cayman Islands' coat of arms is also complex due to its many details. It would be best to source an existing SVG version of the coat of arms and scale it to fit within the white disc.

6. Close the SVG document:
