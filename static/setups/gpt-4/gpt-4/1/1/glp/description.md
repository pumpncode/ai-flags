The flag of Guadeloupe is not standardized, as it is an overseas region of France and officially uses the French flag. However, the unofficial local flag of Guadeloupe features a red field (#FF0000) with a white-bordered green sugar cane (#008000) in the center, a yellow sun (#FFD700) above the sugar cane, and a blue stripe (#0000FF) at the bottom representing the sea. The unofficial flag does not have standardized color codes, aspect ratio, geometric properties, or measurements since it is not officially recognized by any government organization.
