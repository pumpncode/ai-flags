The flag of Romania consists of three vertical stripes of equal width, arranged in the following order: blue (#002B7F) on the hoist side, yellow (#FCD116) in the center, and red (#CE1126) on the fly side. The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning that its length is 1.5 times its width. As for geometric properties, the flag is a simple rectangle with no other distinguishing shapes or patterns. Measurements depend on the specific flag's size, but the proportion between length and width remains constant across different dimensions.
