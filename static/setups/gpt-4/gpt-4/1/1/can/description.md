The flag of Canada, also known as the Maple Leaf or l'Unifoli√©, has the following specifications:

1. Colors: The flag features two colors:
   - Red (Pantone 032): HEX #FF0000, RGB (255, 0, 0)
   - White: HEX #FFFFFF, RGB (255, 255, 255)

2. Aspect ratio: The flag's aspect ratio is 1:2, meaning that its width is twice its height.

3. Geometric properties and measurements:
   - The flag is divided into three vertical sections (bands) with width proportions of 1:2:1.
   - The outer bands are red, and the middle band is white.
   - Within the central white band, there is a stylized 11-point red maple leaf centered vertically and horizontally.
   - The maple leaf is set within an imaginary square of half the flag's height (H/2), and its edges touch the midpoint of this square's sides.
   - Horizontal edges of the maple leaf are parallel to the horizontal edges of the square.
   - The distance between the base of the maple leaf and the bottom edge of the flag is equal to H/4.
   - The distance between the tip of the maple leaf and the top edge of the flag is also equal to H/4.

These specifications ensure a visually balanced and recognizable design for the Canadian flag without including any symbolic interpretations.
