Aspect ratio: 1:2

Geometric properties and measurements:
1. The width of the white St. Andrew's Saltire is 1/15 of the flag's height.
2. The width of the white border on the red St. Patrick's Saltire is 1/30 of the flag's height.
3. The width of the red St. Patrick's Saltire is also 1/15 of the flag's height (excluding the white border).
4. The width of St. George's Cross is 1/5 of the flag's height, with the red part 1/6 and the white fimbriation (border) 1/30 of the flag's height.

The Union Jack has no set dimensions for its various elements; they are specified as proportional to the flag's height as noted above.
