The flag of Jordan has an aspect ratio of 1:2, meaning it is twice as long as it is tall. The flag consists of three horizontal stripes and a red chevron originating from the hoist side (left side when viewed). The colors and their respective HEX codes are:

1. Black stripe at the top: #000000
2. White stripe in the middle: #FFFFFF
3. Green stripe at the bottom: #007A3D
4. Red chevron: #CE1126

The red chevron is based on two parallel lines connected at a 90-degree angle with the height equal to the height of the flag. The length of the chevron extends through one-third of the flag's length. Within the red chevron, there is a seven-pointed star which is centered within the chevron and aligned vertically with the center of the white stripe. The star's color is also red (#CE1126).

Exact dimensions or measurements may vary depending on the specific use or context of the flag.
