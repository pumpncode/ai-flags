The flag of Kosovo features a blue background with a gold map of Kosovo and six white stars. The aspect ratio is 5:7. In the Pantone color system, the blue is Pantone 286 C (Hex code: #0044AA), and the gold is Pantone 116 C (Hex code: #FFCC00). The white stars have no specific Pantone or Hex code, but they are standard white.

The flag consists of a blue field with a golden silhouette of Kosovo centered on it. Above the map, there's an arc of six white, five-pointed stars starting from lower left and ending at lower right, arched in such a way that the center stars are higher up than the end stars. The distance between each adjacent pair of stars is equal, and their dimensions are identical.

However, for more precise geometric properties and measurements, it would be best to consult official documentation, as these details may not be easily available online.
