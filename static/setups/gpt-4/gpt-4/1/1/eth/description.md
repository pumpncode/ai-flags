Aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning its height is half the length of its width.

The emblem in the center features a five-pointed star with rays connecting the star points to a circular outer border. The diameter of the blue circle is half the height of the flag. The emblem's dimensions and geometric properties aren't standardized, so they may vary slightly between different flag versions.

While the exact measurements of the flag can differ, as long as the aspect ratio of 1:2 is maintained, the flag will be considered accurate.
