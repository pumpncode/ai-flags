The flag of Malta consists of two vertical bands of equal width. The left band is red (#CF142B), while the right band is white (#FFFFFF). In the top-left corner, there is a gray George Cross with a red fimbriation (#C8102E). Its aspect ratio is 2:3.

The George Cross is a silver square, and its arms measure 1/6 of the flag's height, forming four right angles. Red borders surround it, measuring 1/60th of the flag's height each. The cross's width occupies 1/4 of the flag's hoist side.

While the exact measurements may differ depending on the flag's size, the proportions and color codes mentioned above remain consistent.
