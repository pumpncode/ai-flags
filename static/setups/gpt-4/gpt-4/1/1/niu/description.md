The flag of Niue consists of two parts:

1. A Union Jack in the upper left corner.
2. A golden yellow field with a centered circle that contains a star pattern.

Unfortunately, I cannot provide specific color codes or detailed measurements for the flag's elements as they are not standardized. The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning it is twice as long as it is tall.
