The flag of the Netherlands consists of three horizontal stripes with colors (from top to bottom) red, white, and blue. The color codes in Pantone and RGB are:

- Red: Pantone 1795 C, RGB (174, 28, 40)
- White: Pantone Safe, RGB (255, 255, 255)
- Blue: Pantone 280 C, RGB (33, 70, 139)

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, where its width is two units, and its length is three units. Since the flag has three equally sized horizontal stripes, each stripe takes up one-third, or approximately 0.333, of the flag's total length.

There are no specific geometric properties or measurements beyond those mentioned, as the flag can be scaled proportionally to any desired size while still maintaining the same proportions and appearance.
