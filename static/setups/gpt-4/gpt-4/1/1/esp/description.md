The flag of Spain has an aspect ratio of 2:3. It consists of three horizontal stripes: the top and bottom stripes are red (#AA151B), while the middle stripe is yellow (#F1BF00) and twice the height of the red stripes.

In the center-left portion of the yellow band, there is the national coat of arms which measures half the height of the yellow band. The coat of arms features a vertically divided shield with multiple sections representing different regions of Spain, with the royal crown on top and two pillars on the sides.

Exact dimensions and measurements may vary depending on specific flag usage.
