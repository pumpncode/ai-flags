The flag of Germany consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width. The colors, from top to bottom, are black (#000000), red (#FF0000), and gold (#FFCC00). The aspect ratio of the flag is 3:5, meaning its width is 1.67 times its height. The geometric properties consist of three parallel rectangles, each occupying one-third of the total flag area. No additional symbols or emblems are present on the flag.
