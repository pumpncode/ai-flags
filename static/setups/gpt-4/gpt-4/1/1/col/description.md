The flag of Colombia consists of three horizontal stripes:

1. Top stripe: Yellow (#FCD116), occupying half the height of the flag (50%)
2. Middle stripe: Blue (#003893), occupying one quarter (25%) of the flag's height
3. Bottom stripe: Red (#CE1126), also occupying one quarter (25%) of the flag's height

The flag has an aspect ratio of 2:3, meaning its width is 1.5 times its height. However, specific geometric properties or measurements are not standardized, as they would depend on the size of the flag being produced.
