The flag of Réunion does not have an official design, as it is a French overseas department and uses the flag of France (Tricolor) as its official emblem. The French flag consists of three vertical stripes of equal width with blue (#002395), white (#FFFFFF), and red (#ED2939) colors, respectively, from left to right. The aspect ratio of the French flag is 2:3.

However, there is a local unofficial flag of Réunion called "Lö Mahavéli," which features four equal horizontal stripes of yellow (#FCDD09), white (#FFFFFF), red (#E40127), and green (#00945F); and a square blue (#003595) canton in the upper hoist side with a stylized, yellow-bordered depiction of the island in the middle. There isn't specific information available on its exact color codes or aspect ratio, but it is often depicted with an aspect ratio of 2:3.
