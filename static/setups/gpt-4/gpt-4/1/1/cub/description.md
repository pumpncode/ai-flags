The flag of Cuba has an aspect ratio of 1:2. It features five alternating horizontal stripes of blue (#0033A0) and white (#FFFFFF) with three blue stripes and two white stripes. On the left side, a red equilateral triangle (#CE1126) is placed along the hoist with its base touching the stripes. Inside this triangle, a white five-pointed star is centered.

Geometric properties:
- The length of each stripe is equal to the width of the flag.
- The height of each stripe is 1/5th the height of the flag.
- The red triangle's sides are equal to the height of the flag.
- The placement of the white star within the triangle is such that one point faces upwards while the other points touch the midpoint of each triangle side.
