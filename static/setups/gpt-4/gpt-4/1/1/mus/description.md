The flag of Mauritius consists of four horizontal stripes of equal width. The colors of the stripes, from top to bottom, are red (Pantone 186), blue (Pantone Reflex Blue), yellow (Pantone Yellow), and green (Pantone 347). The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3.

To be more precise with color codes:
1. Red: Pantone 186 | Hex #E2231A | RGB(226, 35, 26)
2. Blue: Pantone Reflex Blue | Hex #171796 | RGB(23, 23, 150)
3. Yellow: Pantone Yellow | Hex #FFD600 | RGB(255, 214, 0)
4. Green: Pantone 347 | Hex #009543 | RGB(0, 149, 67)

Each stripe occupies one-fourth of the flag's height, which can be calculated by dividing the total height of the flag by four. For instance, if the flag's height is 90 cm, each stripe would measure 22.5 cm. The total width of the flag remains unchanged as the stripes run horizontally.
