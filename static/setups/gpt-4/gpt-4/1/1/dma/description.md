The flag of Dominica has an aspect ratio of 1:2. It features a green background with a centered cross consisting of three horizontal and vertical bands of yellow (#FCD116), white, and black (#000000). The cross creates four rectangles in the corners of the flag.

A circular emblem, containing ten lime-green stars (#57D53B) representing parishes, is placed on the intersection of the cross's bands. Inside the circle, there is a red disk (#CE1126) with a centered Sisserou Parrot (Amazona imperialis), facing the hoist side.
