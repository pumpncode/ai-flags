The Union Jack in the canton measures one quarter of the flag's width and one half of its length. It consists of three crosses: St. George's Cross (red on white), St. Andrew's Cross (white diagonal on blue), and St. Patrick's Cross (red diagonal on white).

The nine stars are five-pointed, representing the nine islands of Tuvalu. They are placed in a specific U-shaped configuration that roughly mimics the geographical arrangement of the islands. Each star is rotated so that one point points directly away from the center of the flag's width. The size of the stars and the precise distances between them vary depending on the manufacturer or source, as there is no standard specification for these measurements.
