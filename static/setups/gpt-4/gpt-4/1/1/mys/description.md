The flag of Malaysia, also known as Jalur Gemilang, has an aspect ratio of 1:2. It consists of 14 alternating red (#CC0000) and white (#FFFFFF) horizontal stripes of equal width, with a blue (#010066) canton in the upper hoist-side quadrant. The canton contains a yellow crescent moon and a 14-pointed star, both also in yellow (#FFD700).

In terms of geometric properties:
1. Stripes: Each stripe is 1/14th of the flag's height.
2. Canton: Its width spans 1/4 of the flag's length, and its height covers 7 (half) of the 14 horizontal stripes.
3. Crescent: The inner circle has a radius of 1/20th of the flag's length, while the outer circle has a radius of 1/8th of the flag's length. The distance from the bottom left corner of the canton to the crescent center is 3/20 of the flag's length horizontally and 1/4 of the flag's height vertically.
4. Star: The 14-pointed star is inscribed within an imaginary circle with a radius of 1/16 of the flag's length. The distance from the canton's bottom left corner to the star's center is 11/40 of the flag's length horizontally and 15/28 of the flag's height vertically.

These measurements ensure a balanced and symmetrical design for the Malaysian flag.
