The flag of China, also known as the Five-starred Red Flag, has an aspect ratio of 2:3. The background is entirely red (color code: #DE2910). On the upper hoist-side corner, there are five yellow stars (color code: #FFD700).

The largest star, centrally located near the top-left corner, has an outer diameter of 3/10th the flag's height and an inner diameter of 1/14th the flag's height. It is positioned at 1/8th of the flag's length and 1/10th of its height away from the hoist and the top edge, respectively.

There are four smaller stars surrounding the larger one in a semicircle pattern. Each smaller star has an outer diameter of 1/10th the flag's height and an inner diameter of 7/75th the flag's height. They are all oriented with one point facing directly towards the center of the large star. Their relative positions are:

- First smaller star: 1/16th of the flag's length and 2/5ths of the large star's diameter away from the large star's center.
- Second smaller star: 1/30th of the flag's length and 1/2 of the large star's diameter away from the large star's center.
- Third smaller star: 1/25th of the flag's length and 1/3rd of the large star's diameter away from the large star's center.
- Fourth smaller star: 3/20ths of the flag's length and 1/6th of the large star's diameter away from the large star's center.
