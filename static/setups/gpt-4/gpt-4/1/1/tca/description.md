The flag of the Turks and Caicos Islands consists of a blue field (Pantone 286C) with a Union Jack in the canton (top left corner) and the coat of arms centered on the right side. The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2.

The Union Jack has three elements: St. George's Cross (red, Pantone 186C), St. Andrew's Cross (white, Pantone White C), and St. Patrick's Cross (red, Pantone 186C). The coat of arms features a yellow shield (Pantone Yellow C) with a conch shell, lobster, and cactus on it.

As for geometric properties, due to varying levels of detail in the coat of arms, it's difficult to provide precise measurements. Generally, the Union Jack canton occupies one-quarter of the flag's area, with its dimensions being half the height and width of the flag. The coat of arms is typically centered within the remaining three-quarters of the flag.

Other details like exact measurements or placement of the coat of arms can vary depending on the manufacturer or specific design, but the overall layout remains consistent.
