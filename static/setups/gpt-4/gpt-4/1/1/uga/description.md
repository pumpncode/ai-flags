The flag of Uganda consists of six horizontal stripes and a white circle in the center with a grey crowned crane inside. The colors and their respective color codes are:

1. Black (top stripe) - Hex: #000000, RGB: (0, 0, 0)
2. Yellow - Hex: #FCD116, RGB: (252, 209, 22)
3. Red - Hex: #CE1126, RGB: (206, 17, 38)
4. Black - Hex: #000000, RGB: (0, 0, 0)
5. Yellow - Hex: #FCD116, RGB: (252, 209, 22)
6. Red (bottom stripe) - Hex: #CE1126, RGB: (206, 17, 38)

The grey crowned crane has these colors:
1. Grey - Hex: #BCC6CC, RGB: (188, 198, 204)
2. White - Hex: #FFFFFF, RGB: (255, 255, 255)

The aspect ratio of the Ugandan flag is 2:3.

For the geometric properties and measurements, imagine the flag is divided into 18 horizontal units (considering that the width is twice the height):

- Each stripe has a thickness of three units.
- The diameter of the white circle is equal to the height of the flag (18 units).
- The grey crowned crane is centered within the white circle and occupies approximately two-thirds of the circle's area.
