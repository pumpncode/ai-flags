The flag of Guyana consists of five main colors. The aspect ratio is 3:5, meaning the flag's width is 3 units and its length is 5 units. It features a green field with a large red isosceles triangle bordered by a narrower white triangle on the hoist side, followed by a golden isosceles triangle (fimbriated in black) extending to the fly side. 

Colors with their respective HEX codes are as follows:
1. Green: #009E49
2. Red: #CE1126
3. White: #FFFFFF
4. Golden (yellow): #FCD116
5. Black: #000000

In terms of geometric properties, the central golden triangle has its base on the hoist side and vertex at the midpoint of the fly side. The black and white fimbriations form two smaller isosceles triangles adjacent to the golden one, with the white triangle being smaller than the black one. Finally, the largest red triangle has its base along the entire length of the flag and its vertex touching the opposite corner on the fly side.
