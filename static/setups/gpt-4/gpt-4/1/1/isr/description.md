The flag of Israel consists of three horizontal stripes and a hexagram. Here are its specifications:

1. Colors:
   - Blue (Pantone 286 C): #0038B8
   - White: #FFFFFF

2. Aspect ratio: 8:11

3. Geometric properties and measurements:
   - The top and bottom blue stripes are equal in width, each occupying 1/12 of the flag's height.
   - The white stripe between the blue stripes occupies 2/3 of the flag's height.
   - The blue hexagram, known as the Star of David, is centered on the white stripe.
   - The diameter of the circle that circumscribes the hexagram equals 1/6 of the flag's height.
   - The hexagram's vertices touch the circle, which does not appear on the flag.

These properties define the appearance of the Israeli flag without going into its symbolism.
