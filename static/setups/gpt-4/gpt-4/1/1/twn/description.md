The flag of Taiwan, also known as the Republic of China (ROC), has an aspect ratio of 2:3. The flag consists of two main components:

1. A red field (color code: #FE0000).
2. A blue canton in the upper hoist-side corner (color code: #002A66) with a diameter of 2/5ths the width of the flag, featuring a white sun (color code: #FFFFFF) with 12 rays.

The white sun is situated within the blue canton and has a diameter of 3/5ths of the blue canton's diameter. Each ray of the sun is 30 degrees apart, and the rays are designed in alternating long and short shapes.

There are no official geometric properties or specific measurements for the flag; it should be proportionally resized based on the desired dimensions while maintaining the aspect ratio and relative sizes of its elements.
