2. A green "Y" shape, its arms start close to the left border, extend towards the flag's center, and continue horizontally to the right border.
3. A black isosceles triangle on the left, bordered by a gold stripe, between the upper arm of the "Y" and the upper-horizontal edge of the flag.
4. A blue isosceles triangle on the left, bordered by a gold stripe, between the lower arm of the "Y" and the lower-horizontal edge of the flag.

The flag doesn't have specific measurements for the shapes and stripes, but their proportions should be consistent with the overall aspect ratio of 2:3.
