The flag of Lebanon features three horizontal stripes and a green cedar tree in the center. The top and bottom stripes are red (#ED1C24), while the middle stripe is white (#FFFFFF). The cedar tree is colored green (#008000).

The flag's aspect ratio is 2:3, meaning its width is 2 units while its length is 3 units. The red stripes each occupy 1/6th of the flag's length, while the white stripe occupies 2/6ths (or 1/3rd) of the flag's length. The green cedar tree is placed at the center of the white stripe.

The cedar tree emblem itself touches both the upper and lower horizontal edges of the white stripe, filling the entire height of the stripe. The tree's trunk extends approximately 1/12th of the flag's width horizontally on either side from the center.
