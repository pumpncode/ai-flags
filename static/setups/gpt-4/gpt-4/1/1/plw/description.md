The flag of Palau consists of a light blue field (#4AADD6) with a large yellow circle (#FFDE00) slightly off-centered towards the hoist side. The flag's aspect ratio is 5:8, meaning its width is 1.6 times its height. The diameter of the yellow circle is half the height of the flag. The center of the circle is placed at the point where the flag's length is divided into intervals of 1/6 and 1/4 from the hoist side.
