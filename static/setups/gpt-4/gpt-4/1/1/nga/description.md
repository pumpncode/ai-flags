The flag of Nigeria features three equal vertical stripes. The color codes and layout are as follows:

1. Green (left stripe): Pantone 347 U; HEX #008751; RGB (0,135,81)
2. White (middle stripe): Pantone Safe; HEX #FFFFFF; RGB (255,255,255)
3. Green (right stripe): Pantone 347 U; HEX #008751; RGB (0,135,81)

The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning the width is twice the height. All stripes have the same width, so each stripe's width is one-third of the total width. There are no unique geometric properties or measurements other than the equal width of the vertical stripes.
