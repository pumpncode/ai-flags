The flag of Saint Kitts and Nevis features three equal vertical stripes, with colors green (#007349) on the hoist side, yellow (#FCD116) in the middle, and red (#CE1126) at the fly. There is a black diagonal stripe (#000000) running from the lower hoist-side corner to the upper fly-side corner, which is two times wider than each vertical stripe. In the center of the black stripe, there are two white, five-pointed stars (#FFFFFF).

The flag has an aspect ratio of 3:5 (height:width). Since I cannot provide physical measurements without knowing the desired flag size, the geometric properties can always be scaled to match the intended dimensions while maintaining the aspect ratio.

Additional information:
- The position of the stars: one star touching both green and red stripes, and the other touching both yellow and red stripes.
- The orientation of the stars: Each star's point oriented towards the top hoist-side corner.
- Stars' size: The diameter of each circumscribed circle around a star is equal to half the width of the black diagonal stripe.
