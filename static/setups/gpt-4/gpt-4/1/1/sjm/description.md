Svalbard and Jan Mayen do not have an official, unique flag representing the territories. These are Norwegian territories, so they usually use the flag of Norway to represent themselves. The Norwegian flag has red (#C8102E), white (#FFFFFF), and blue (#002664) colors with a Scandinavian Cross design. The flag's aspect ratio is 22:16, and the cross design has specific geometric properties:

1. The width of the white cross is 6 units.
2. The width of the blue cross is 4 units.
3. The height and length of the red field are each 22 and 16 units respectively.

However, there is no separate flag for Svalbard and Jan Mayen with specific color codes or other details.
