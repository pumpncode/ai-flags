The flag of Algeria has two vertical bands of equal width and a red, five-pointed star enclosing a crescent in the center. The aspect ratio is 2:3. 

Left band color: Green (RGB: 0, 98, 51; HEX: #006233)
Right band color: White (RGB: 255, 255, 255; HEX: #FFFFFF)
Crescent and star color: Red (RGB: 213, 43, 30; HEX: #D52B1E)

The red star is inscribed within an invisible circle that is tangent to the inner edges of the crescent. The circle's diameter is 2/5 of the flag's width. The crescent opening faces the right side of the flag, with its endpoints on the green-white boundary.
