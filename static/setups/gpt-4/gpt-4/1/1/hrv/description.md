The flag of Croatia has a unique design with three horizontal stripes, a coat of arms in the center, and a distinctive red-and-white checkered shield. The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2.

Colors:
1. Red (top stripe): Pantone 186 C, HEX #FF0000, RGB(255, 0, 0)
2. White (middle stripe): Pantone Safe, HEX #FFFFFF, RGB(255, 255, 255)
3. Blue (bottom stripe): Pantone 286 C, HEX #0033A0, RGB(0, 51, 160)

Each stripe occupies one-third of the flag's height. In the middle, there is a coat of arms that consists of the aforementioned red-and-white checkered shield pattern, known as šahovnica, and five smaller shields above it, representing historical regions of Croatia. The šahovnica has 13 rows of alternating red and white squares, starting with a red square in the top-left corner. The coat of arms extends over all three stripes and measures half the width of the flag.

The smaller shields above the šahovnica represent (from left to right): Dubrovnik (azure field with two argent barry), Dalmatia (argent with azure crowned lion passant guardant), Istria (field of azure strewn with argent goat heads), Slavonia (field of argent with six soaring birds in their natural color, a wavy azure line beneath), and a silver six-pointed star on blue for Croatia proper.

These are the main characteristics of the Croatian flag without delving into its symbolism.
