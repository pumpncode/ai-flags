The flag of the Solomon Islands consists of a thin yellow diagonal stripe that divides the flag into two triangles. The upper triangle is blue (Pantone 286 C) and the lower triangle is green (Pantone 355 C). The stripe is edged on both sides by a thinner white stripe. At the hoist side of the flag, in the blue triangle, there are five white stars forming an approximate right angle, pointing outwards.

Colors:
- Blue: Pantone 286 C, HEX #0033AB, RGB (0,51,187)
- Green: Pantone 355 C, HEX #009E60, RGB (0,158,96)
- Yellow: Pantone 116 C, HEX #FFCD00, RGB (255,205,0)
- White: HEX #FFFFFF, RGB (255,255,255)

The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning its length is twice its height. Exact geometric properties, measurements or sizes vary depending on the specific flag's intended use or production run.
