The flag of Honduras consists of three horizontal stripes and five blue stars in the center. The color codes are as follows:

- Blue: Pantone 286C (Hex: #0C1C8C)
- White: Pantone Safe (Hex: #FFFFFF)

The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning its width is twice its height. The horizontal stripes are equal in size, each occupying one-third of the flag's height.

In the center of the white stripe, there are five blue stars arranged in an X shape. The stars are regular five-pointed stars, with equal side lengths and angles. Each point of the stars is 36 degrees apart, making a full circle of 180 degrees. The inner angle at the peak of each star is 108 degrees. The stars represent the five nations of the United States of Central America. In terms of measurements, the distance between the stars and their sizes may vary slightly depending on the specific flag manufacturer or representation.
