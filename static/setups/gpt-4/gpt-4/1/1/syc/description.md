The flag of Seychelles has five oblique bands of different colors radiating from the bottom left corner to the top right corner. The aspect ratio is 1:2. 

Colors and their corresponding hex color codes:
1. Blue (top): #0035AD
2. Yellow: #FCD116
3. Red: #CE1126
4. White: #FFFFFF
5. Green (bottom): #049648

The flag is divided into six triangular sections, with each color occupying one or two triangular segments. The blue, yellow, and red colors form three larger triangles that start at the bottom left corner and touch the midpoint of the opposite edge. White and green colors form two smaller triangles adjacent to the large red triangle at the top and bottom respectively.

There are no specific measurements given for the geometric properties; however, the design can be reconstructed by maintaining the aspect ratio and dividing the flag accordingly into the mentioned triangular sections.
