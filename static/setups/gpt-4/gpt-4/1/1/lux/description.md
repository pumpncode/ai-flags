The flag of Luxembourg consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width. The top stripe is red (Pantone 032 C), the middle stripe is white, and the bottom stripe is light blue (Pantone 299 C). The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning the length is twice the height. No official geometric properties or measurements are specified for the flag's construction beyond the aspect ratio and the arrangement of the horizontal stripes.
