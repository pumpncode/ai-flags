As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the Caribbean Netherlands doesn't have a single unified flag representing all its islands. Instead, each island has its individual flag:

1. Bonaire: Red (CD002B), blue (0076D5), yellow (F9D616) and white colors; 2:3 aspect ratio; diagonal yellow stripe, red triangle at the hoist side, blue triangle at the fly end, a black compass rose with six-pointed white star in the blue section.

2. Saba: Red (CF112D), blue (003893), gold (FFC726), and white colors; 2:3 aspect ratio; horizontal tricolor of red, white, and blue with a gold, five-pointed star centered on the red stripe.

3. Sint Eustatius: Blue (0044A8), white, green (009E49), red (AE1C28), and gold colors; 2:3 aspect ratio; three horizontal stripes of blue, white, and green, with the coat of arms centered on the white stripe.
