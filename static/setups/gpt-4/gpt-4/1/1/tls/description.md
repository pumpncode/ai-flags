The flag of Timor-Leste consists of four colors and has an aspect ratio of 1:2. The flag is divided into a large isosceles triangle with its base at the hoist side and a smaller isosceles triangle with its base along the fly edge, creating three distinct areas:

1. Red field (Pantone 485C) - covers the majority of the flag.
2. Black isosceles triangle (Pantone Black C) - has its base at the hoist side and overlaps the red field.
3. White isosceles triangle (Pantone White) - smaller than the black one, positioned inside the black triangle.
4. A yellow (Pantone 1235C) equilateral triangle runs from the midpoint of the black triangle's base to the apex of the white triangle.

The size of each colored area in the flag lacks specific measurements as long as the geometric shapes are proportionally maintained within the given aspect ratio of 1:2.
