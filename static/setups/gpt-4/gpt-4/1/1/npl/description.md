The flag of Nepal is unique, as it's the only national flag that isn't rectangular. It consists of two overlapping red pennants with blue borders. The top pennant has a white stylized moon, and the bottom one has a white 12-point sun.

Color Codes:
- Red: #DC143C
- Blue: #003893
- White: #FFFFFF

The flag doesn't have a fixed aspect ratio due to its geometric complexity, but it can be constructed using specific measurements:

1. Draw a horizontal line (A) with length equal to 4 units.
2. At A's midpoint, draw a vertical line (B) with length 3 units.
3. From B's endpoint, draw two lines (C1 and C2) meeting at the midpoint of A, forming a triangle.
4. On line B, mark a point D at 1 unit from A.
5. Draw a line (E) parallel to A, starting from D and ending on C1.
6. Draw a line (F) from D such that it meets C2 perpendicularly.
7. At F's endpoint, create a similar triangle structure for the lower pennant.

For the sun and the moon:
- Moon: An 8-unit circle touching B and C2; add a crescent shape inside.
- Sun: A 4-unit circle touching B and C1; surround it with 12 equally spaced triangular rays.

While these are general guidelines for constructing the flag, there might be minor variations in proportions and dimensions when used in practice.
