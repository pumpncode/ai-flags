The flag of Senegal consists of three vertical stripes of equal width and a green five-pointed star at the center of the middle stripe. The colors are as follows:

1. Left stripe - Green (#008000)
2. Middle stripe - Yellow (#FED116)
3. Right stripe - Red (#CE1126)

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, which means that the width is two-thirds of its length. Each of the three stripes occupies one-third of the flag's total width. Since the star is positioned on the yellow stripe, it is equidistant from both top and bottom edges.

Regarding the five-pointed star, it has an inscribed circle radius of 1/15th the flag's width, and its points touch the circumcircle. The star's color is also green (#008000).
