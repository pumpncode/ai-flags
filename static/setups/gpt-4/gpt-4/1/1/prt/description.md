The flag of Portugal has an aspect ratio of 2:3, meaning it is twice as long as it is tall. The design consists of two vertical bands and a central emblem.

The left band is green (RGB: 0, 102, 0 / Hex: #006600) and takes up 2/5 of the flag's total width. The right band is red (RGB: 255, 0, 0 / Hex: #FF0000) and occupies the remaining 3/5.

At the boundary of the two bands lies the central emblem, which includes the coat of arms of Portugal on a white circle (RGB: 255, 255, 255 / Hex: #FFFFFF). The circle touches both top and bottom edges of the flag but does not extend beyond them. The coat of arms consists of a shield with seven castles and five smaller blue shields, all outlined in yellow (RGB: 255, 204, 0 / Hex: #FFCC00).

To recreate the flag, maintain the 2:3 proportion and allocate appropriate colors and space for each element using the provided color codes and geometric properties.
