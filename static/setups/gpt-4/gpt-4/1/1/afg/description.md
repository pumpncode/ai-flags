The flag of Afghanistan has an aspect ratio of 2:3. It consists of three vertical stripes of equal width, ordered from left to right as black (#000000), red (#BF0A30), and green (#009543). In the center of the red stripe is the national emblem in white. The emblem features a mosque with pulpit and flags on either side below a representation of the sun with rays emitting upward. There are two inscriptions around the central emblem, one above and another below. Exact measurements and other geometric properties for the emblem can vary depending on the source.
