The flag of Vatican City is a vertical bicolour flag with an aspect ratio of 1:1, meaning it is a square. The left half is yellow (#FFD700) and the right half is white (#FFFFFF). On the white half, there are two crossed keys (one gold, one silver), connected by a red cord, and a Papal Tiara above them. The flag doesn't have any specific measurements as it can be resized proportionally.
