The flag of Albania features a black, double-headed eagle on a red background. The aspect ratio of the flag is 5:7. The color codes are as follows:

Red background: Pantone 186 C (RGB: 199, 56, 58; HEX: #C7383A)
Black double-headed eagle: Pantone Black C (RGB: 45, 41, 38; HEX: #2D2926)

The flag does not have specific geometric properties or measurements universally defined, but the double-headed eagle is typically centered and should occupy most of the field. As for other relevant information, I abstain from delving into the symbolism, as per your request.
