The flag of Syria consists of three horizontal stripes and two stars within a circle. The colors and their respective HEX codes are as follows:

1. Red (top stripe): #CE1126
2. White (middle stripe): #FFFFFF
3. Black (bottom stripe): #000000

The green stars within the white circle are at HEX code #007A3D.

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning it is two units tall for every three units wide. The width of each stripe is 1/3 of the flag's height. The circle containing the green stars is centered on the middle (white) stripe, with a diameter measuring 2/5 of the flag's height. The five-pointed green stars are positioned in such a way that their centers are equally placed on the circumference of the invisible white circle, with one star at the top and the other at the bottom.
