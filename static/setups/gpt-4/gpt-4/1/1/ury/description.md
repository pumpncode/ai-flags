The flag of Uruguay features nine horizontal stripes alternating between white (#FFFFFF) and light blue (#0038A8), with a white canton in the upper hoist-side corner containing a golden sun with alternating straight and wavy rays. The aspect ratio is 3:2.

Geometric properties and measurements:

1. Stripes: There are 9 horizontal stripes, each occupying 1/9th of the flag's height.
2. Canton: In the top-left corner, the canton is a white square that spans down to the 5th stripe, meaning it covers half the height of the flag and has a 1:1 aspect ratio.
3. Sun: Located in the center of the canton, it has a face and 16 rays (8 straight and 8 wavy) surrounding it. The diameter of the sun is equal to 11/15 the height of the canton.
