The flag of France, also known as the Tricolore, consists of three vertical stripes of equal width. The colors and their corresponding hex color codes are:

1. Blue (left stripe): #002395
2. White (middle stripe): #FFFFFF
3. Red (right stripe): #ED2939

The flag has an aspect ratio of 2:3, meaning that its width is 1.5 times its height. Geometrically, it is a simple rectangle divided into three equal parts.

No specific measurements are provided for the flag's dimensions, but the ratio must be maintained when creating or reproducing the flag.
