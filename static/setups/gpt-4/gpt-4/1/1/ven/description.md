The flag of Venezuela has an aspect ratio of 2:3. It consists of three horizontal bands of equal height, with the following colors (from top to bottom) and their respective hexadecimal color codes:

1. Yellow: #FFCC00
2. Blue: #003893
3. Red: #CF142B

An arc of eight white, five-pointed stars is located in the center of the blue band. The stars form a circle with an imaginary radius that reaches around one-third of the height of the blue band.

The flag doesn't have a strict set of measurements; it can be scaled up or down as long as the aspect ratio and proportions are maintained.
