The flag of Peru features three vertical stripes: red, white, and red. The aspect ratio is 2:3. Here are the color codes and geometric properties:

1. Red (Pantone 186 C): RGB (203, 32, 39), HEX #CB2027
2. White: RGB (255, 255, 255), HEX #FFFFFF

Stripe width is equal for all three bands, with each being 1/3 of the flag's width.

There are no specific measurements provided for the flag; however, its dimensions should maintain the 2:3 aspect ratio. This means that if the width of the flag is W, its height would be 2W/3.
