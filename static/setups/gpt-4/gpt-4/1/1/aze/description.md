The flag of Azerbaijan consists of three horizontal stripes of equal size, with an aspect ratio of 1:2. The top stripe is blue (#006a44), the middle stripe is red (#ed2939), and the bottom stripe is green (#3e9a49). In the center of the red stripe, there's a white crescent moon (#ffffff) pointing towards the right side of the flag, accompanied by an eight-pointed star immediately to its right. The diameter of the circle that circumscribes the star is half the height of the red stripe. Each point of the star has two different lengths: the longer outer points have a length equal to 1/20th of the flag's width, while the shorter inner points have a length equal to 1/40th of the flag's width. The distance from the center of the crescent to the center of the star is equal to 1/30th of the flag's width.
