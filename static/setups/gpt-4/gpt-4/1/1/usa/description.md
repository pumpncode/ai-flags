The flag of the United States, also known as the Stars and Stripes, has the following properties:

- Aspect ratio: The flag has an aspect ratio of 1.9:1 (length to width). The official dimensions are 1.0 by 1.9 units.
- Colors: The flag consists of three colors with the following Pantone codes: 
  - Red (PMS 193 C): #B22234
  - White: #FFFFFF
  - Blue (PMS 282 C): #3C3B6E
- Geometric properties:
  - Thirteen horizontal stripes of equal width, alternating red and white, starting and ending with a red stripe.
  - A blue canton (rectangular area) in the top-left corner, covering the first seven stripes. Its dimensions are 0.5385 (height) x 0.76 (width) in proportion to the full flag size.
  - Inside the canton, there are 50 white, five-pointed stars arranged in nine rows, alternating between six and five stars per row.
- Measurements: Official measurements prescribe that each stripe should be 1/13th of the flag's height (0.7692... units), while each star's diameter should be approximately 0.0616 times the flag's hoist width (0.1111 units).

Note that these proportions are for official U.S. government flags. Commercial flag sizes might vary slightly.
