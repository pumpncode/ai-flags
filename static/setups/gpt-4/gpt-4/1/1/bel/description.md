The flag of Belgium has three vertical stripes of equal width in the following order and colors: black (#000000), yellow (#FDDA24), and red (#EF3340). The aspect ratio of the flag is 13:15, meaning it is 13 units tall and 15 units wide. Each stripe takes up one-third of the flag's width. There is no specific pattern or emblem on the Belgian flag, so the design consists solely of the three colored stripes.
