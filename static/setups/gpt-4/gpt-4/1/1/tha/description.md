The flag of Thailand consists of five horizontal stripes with the color order of red (top), white, blue, white, and red (bottom). The color codes for these stripes are:

1. Red: Pantone 186C, Hex #D11236
2. White: Pantone Safe, Hex #FFFFFF
3. Blue: Pantone 280C, Hex #081A70

The aspect ratio of the Thai flag is 2:3, which means its width is two units and its height is three units. The geometric properties and measurements of the stripes are as follows:

1. Top red stripe: 2:6 (1/6 of the height)
2. First white stripe: 2:6 (1/6 of the height)
3. Blue stripe: 2:2 (1/2 of the height)
4. Second white stripe: 2:6 (1/6 of the height)
5. Bottom red stripe: 2:6 (1/6 of the height)

This arrangement gives the appearance of a wide blue band in the middle, flanked by two thin white bands and two thinner red bands at the top and bottom.
