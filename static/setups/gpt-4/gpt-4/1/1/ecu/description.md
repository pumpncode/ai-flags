The flag of Ecuador consists of horizontal stripes and an emblem. The aspect ratio is 2:3. There are three stripes: yellow (Pantone 116C) at the top, covering 50% of the flag's height; blue (Pantone 286C) in the middle, covering 25%; and red (Pantone 485C) at the bottom, also covering 25%.

The emblem, the Ecuadorian coat of arms, is placed off-centered towards the hoist side in the yellow stripe. The geometric properties include a bordered ellipse with various elements inside. The size of the emblem can vary but generally is proportional to the size of the flag itself.

As requested, no description of the symbolism will be provided.
