The flag of Mongolia consists of three vertical bands with an aspect ratio of 1:2. From left to right, the colors are:

1. Red (#D52B1E) band with a width equal to 2/5 of the flag's total width, featuring the national emblem (soyombo) in golden yellow color centered on this band.
2. Blue (#003DA5) band with a width equal to 1/5 of the flag's total width.
3. Red (#D52B1E) band with a width equal to 2/5 of the flag's total width.

The soyombo symbol has various geometric shapes including a flame, sun, moon, triangles, rectangles, and yin-yang circles. The symbol is approximately half the height of the red band and centered vertically in that space.
