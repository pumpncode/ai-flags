The flag of Tanzania consists of a diagonal black band, bordered by two thin yellow stripes, dividing the flag into two triangles (green and blue) with an aspect ratio of 2:3. The exact color codes for the flag are:

1. Green: Pantone 347 - #006233 (Hex) - RGB(0,98,51)
2. Yellow: Pantone 116 - #FCD116 (Hex) - RGB(252,209,22)
3. Black: Pantone Black C - #000000 (Hex) - RGB(0,0,0)
4. Blue: Pantone 300 - #007DB5 (Hex) - RGB(0,125,181)

The width of the yellow bordering stripes is 1/20th of the hoist width, while the width of the black band is twice that of the yellow stripes or 1/10th of the hoist width.

Assuming the total flag's width (W) is 90 units and height (H) is 60 units, you would have the following measurements:

1. Green triangle side lengths: base=45 units, height=60 units
2. Blue triangle side lengths: base=45 units, height=60 units
3. Black band's width: W/10 = 9 units
4. Yellow bordering stripe's width: W/20 = 4.5 units each

These dimensions should be maintained proportionally if you scale the flag to different sizes.
