The flag of South Korea, called the Taegeukgi, has an aspect ratio of 2:3. The background is white (hex color code #FFFFFF). 

In the center of the flag, there is a circle divided into two halves, in red (hex color code #CD2E3A) and blue (hex color code #003478). The circle represents the Taegeuk symbol, where the red half is on the top and the blue half is on the bottom. Each half forms a sine wave shape with an approximate 180-degree phase difference.

On the corners around the Taegeuk symbol are four black trigrams, one in each corner. Each trigram consists of three lines, either broken or unbroken. The arrangement of these trigrams (clockwise starting from the top-left corner) is as follows: Geon (three solid lines), Gam (two solid lines separated by a broken line), Ri (a solid line at the top and bottom with a broken line in the middle), and Gon (two broken lines surrounding a solid line).

The positioning, direction, and size of the Taegeuk and trigrams should be proportionally consistent when scaling the flag.
