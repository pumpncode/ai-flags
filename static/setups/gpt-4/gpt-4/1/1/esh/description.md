Color codes:
1. Red: #C8102E
2. Green: #007A3D
3. Black: #000000
4. White: #FFFFFF

Geometric properties and measurements:

1. The flag is divided into three equal horizontal bands:
   - Top band: Black
   - Middle band: White
   - Bottom band: Green
2. The red equilateral triangle has a base that extends along the entire hoist side (left edge) and an apex opposite the hoist side.
3. Each color stripe occupies one-third of the flag's height.

Since there is no standardized size for flags, the actual length and width may vary depending on usage, but the ratio of 1:2 remains constant.
