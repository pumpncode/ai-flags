The flag of Bahrain consists of two vertical stripes: a white stripe on the left and a red stripe on the right. The white stripe has five equidistant white triangles that form a serrated line, creating a total of five white points.

Colors (Pantone system):
- Red: 186 C
- White: Safe

Aspect Ratio: 3:5

Geometric properties:
1. Divide the length into three parts, with the white stripe occupying one part and the red stripe occupying two parts.
2. The serrated line between the white and red stripe forms five isosceles triangles, with each triangle having an angle of 108Â° at its apex on the serrated line.

No specific measurements are prescribed for the flag; it can be scaled proportionally based on the desired dimensions, as long as the aspect ratio and geometric properties are maintained.
