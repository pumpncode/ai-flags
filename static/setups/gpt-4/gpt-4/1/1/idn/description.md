The flag of Indonesia consists of two equal horizontal bands: the top band is red (color code: #FF0000), and the bottom band is white (color code: #FFFFFF). The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning that its width is two units and its height is three units. As both bands are equal in size, each has a height of 1.5 units. There is no specific pattern or other geometric properties on the flag.
