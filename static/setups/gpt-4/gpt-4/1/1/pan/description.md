The flag of Panama consists of four equal rectangles arranged in a 2x2 layout. The top-left rectangle is white (#FFFFFF), the top-right rectangle is blue (#005293), the bottom-left rectangle is red (#D21034), and the bottom-right rectangle is white.

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning its width is 1.5 times its height. For example, if the height is 100 cm, the width would be 150 cm.

The flag does not have any specific geometric properties or measurements beyond its rectangular shape and aspect ratio.
