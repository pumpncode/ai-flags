The Australian flag has a 1:2 aspect ratio. It consists of a blue field (Pantone 280C) with the Union Jack in the upper hoist-side quadrant, a large white seven-pointed star known as the Commonwealth Star below the Union Jack, and five smaller seven-pointed white stars forming the Southern Cross constellation on the right side of the flag.

Exact geometric measurements:
- The Union Jack occupies the first quarter and is 1/2 the width of the flag.
- The Commonwealth Star's center is placed 3/8 of the flag's width from the hoist edge, and each point of the star is 1/14 of the flag's width long.
- Southern Cross stars A, B, C, D, and E have a diameter of 1/14, 1/14, 1/12, 1/10, and 1/12 respectively, and are positioned proportionally along the fly half of the flag.
