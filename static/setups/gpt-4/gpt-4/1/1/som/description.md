The flag of Somalia has a simple design consisting of a single blue field with a white, five-pointed star in the center. The exact color code for the blue is #4189DD, while the white has the standard hex code of #FFFFFF. Regarding aspect ratio, it measures 2:3, meaning the flag's width is half its length. The five-pointed star is equidistantly placed within the blue field and points outward symmetrically. Due to the minimalistic nature of the design, no other geometric properties or measurements are particularly noteworthy.
