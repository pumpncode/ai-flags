The flag of American Samoa predominantly features red, white, and blue colors. The aspect ratio is 1:2, meaning the flag's length is twice its height.

The flag consists of a red field with a white equilateral triangle pointing towards the hoist side. This triangle has its base on the fly edge (opposite side to the hoist) and its apex at the center of the hoist edge. Inside the white triangle, there is a smaller blue triangle occupying the same position, but having shorter sides. A bald eagle, holding a Samoan uatogi (staff) in one talon and fly-whisk in the other, is centered in the blue area.

Although I don't have the exact color codes for the flag of American Samoa, they can be approximated:

- Red: #CE1126
- White: #FFFFFF
- Blue: #002868
