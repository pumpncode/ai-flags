The United States Minor Outlying Islands do not have a unique official flag. They are a group of small, unincorporated territories of the United States, and each island uses the flag of the United States as their representative flag. 

The U.S. flag, also known as "the Stars and Stripes" or "Old Glory," has the following properties:

- Aspect ratio: 10:19 (1.9)
- Colors, along with their HEX color codes:
  - Red (#B22234): Represents the 13 stripes, alternating red and white
  - White (#FFFFFF): Represents the 13 stripes, alternating red and white
  - Blue (#3C3B6E): Represents the field (union) in the upper hoist-side corner
- Geometry:
  - 13 horizontal stripes, each equal in width, representing the 13 original colonies
  - A blue rectangular field (union) in the upper hoist-side corner, spanning the top seven stripes
- Measurements:
  - The union is 0.5385 times the hoist and extends to the lower edge of the 7th stripe from the top
  - Each stripe is 1/13 of the height of the flag
  - Each star in the union has a diameter of 0.0616 times the hoist

There are 50 white, five-pointed stars arranged in nine rows of alternating five and six stars within the blue field, representing the 50 U.S. states.
