The flag of Myanmar consists of three horizontal stripes with the following color codes:

1. Top stripe: Yellow (#fcd116)
2. Middle stripe: Green (#34b233)
3. Bottom stripe: Red (#ea2839)

There is also a white, five-pointed star centered in the middle of the green stripe. The star has a size equal to 1/3 the width of the green stripe.

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning it is twice as long as it is wide.

In terms of geometric properties and measurements, the width of each stripe is equal (1/3 of the total flag width).
