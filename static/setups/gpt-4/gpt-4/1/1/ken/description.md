The flag of Kenya has a horizontal tricolor design with three equal stripes in the following order: black (#000000) on top, red (#BF0A30) in the middle, and green (#006747) at the bottom. A white fimbriation separates the black and red stripes as well as the red and green stripes. In the center of the flag is a Maasai shield with two crossed spears overlaying it. The shield is predominantly red with black and white accents, while the spears are white.

The aspect ratio of the Kenyan flag is 2:3, which means the width is two-thirds of the length. For example, if the flag's width is 100 cm, its length would be 150 cm. Specific measurements for the features of the flag, like the shield or the fimbriations, are not standardized or available.
