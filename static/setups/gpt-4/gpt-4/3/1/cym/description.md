The flag of the Cayman Islands has an aspect ratio of 1:2. The flag is divided into three vertical stripes with the following color codes and measurements:

1. Blue stripe (RGB: 0, 36, 125) on the hoist side, occupying one-third of the flag's width.
2. White stripe (RGB: 255, 255, 255) in the center, also occupying one-third of the flag's width.
3. Blue stripe (RGB: 0, 36, 125) on the fly side, occupying the remaining one-third of the flag's width.

In the upper left corner of the blue stripe, there is a red Union Jack (RGB: 186, 12, 47), which occupies half of the flag's length and one-third of its width. Within the Union Jack, there is a white disc that measures half the height of the Union Jack. Centered within the white disc is the Cayman Islands' coat of arms, which is approximately three-fifths the height of the white disc.

The coat of arms features a shield with a blue (RGB: 0, 36, 125) and white (RGB: 255, 255, 255) wavy pattern at the bottom, a green (RGB: 0, 102, 0) chevron on top of the waves, and three green stars (RGB: 0, 102, 0) above the chevron. Above the shield is a green turtle on a coil of rope, and below the shield is a scroll with the words "Cayman Islands" in black (RGB: 0, 0, 0).
