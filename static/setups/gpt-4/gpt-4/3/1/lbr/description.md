The flag of Liberia consists of 11 horizontal stripes of alternating red (#BF0A30) and white (#FFFFFF) colors, with the red stripe at the top and bottom. In the upper left corner, there is a blue square (#002868) with a white five-pointed star in the center.

The aspect ratio of the flag is 10:19 (height to length). The blue square spans the height of the first five stripes. The 11 stripes are equal in height, while the white star's diameter is approximately 3/5 of the height of the blue field.

Geometrically, the flag has a rectangular shape with parallel stripes and a smaller square embedded in it. The five-pointed star is inscribed within an invisible circle inside the blue square.
