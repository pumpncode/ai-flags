The flag of Zambia has an aspect ratio of 2:3. It consists of a green background (Pantone 3415C) with a red, black, and orange vertical stripe at the lower fly end. 

The vertical stripe is made up of three equal horizontal stripes: 
1. Red (Pantone 186C) on top
2. Black (Pantone Black C) in the middle
3. Orange (Pantone 151C) at the bottom

At the center of the black stripe, there is an orange African fish eagle (Pantone 151C) facing the hoist side.

Geometric properties:
- The width of the vertical stripe is 1/3 of the flag's width.
- The height of each horizontal stripe within the vertical stripe is 1/9 of the flag's height.
- The African fish eagle is centered within the black stripe and its size is proportional to the stripe's dimensions.
