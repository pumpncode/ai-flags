The flag of Oman consists of three horizontal stripes and a vertical stripe on the hoist side. The top stripe is white, the middle stripe is red, and the bottom stripe is green. The vertical stripe on the hoist side is also red and contains the national emblem of Oman, which is a white dagger (khanjar) and two crossed swords.

Colors:
- White: HEX #FFFFFF
- Red: HEX #D91016
- Green: HEX #008000

The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning its length is twice its width. The horizontal stripes are equal in size, each occupying one-third of the flag's height. The vertical red stripe occupies one-fourth of the flag's length.

I cannot provide exact geometric properties or measurements, as they can vary depending on the physical dimensions of a specific flag. However, the proportions and color codes mentioned above should help you create an accurate representation of the Omani flag.
