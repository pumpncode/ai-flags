The flag of Cyprus has an aspect ratio of 3:2. It features a white field with a copper-colored map of the island (Pantone 1385 C) in the center, above two olive branches in green (Pantone 574 C). The precise geometric properties and measurements are as follows:

1. The width of the flag is divided into 30 equal parts.
2. The height of the flag is divided into 20 equal parts.
3. The map of Cyprus is centered both horizontally and vertically.
4. The map's width is 22 parts, and its height is 11 parts.
5. The olive branches are placed at a distance of 1/30th of the flag's width from each other and are centered vertically below the map.
6. Each olive branch consists of six leaves and one fruit.

These details ensure accuracy and consistency when reproducing the flag.
