The flag of Saint Lucia has an aspect ratio of 1:2. It consists of a blue field (Pantone 286C) with a black isosceles triangle (Pantone Black C) at the center, which is based on the width of the flag and has its vertex touching the upper edge. The black triangle is bordered by two narrower triangles - one white (Pantone White C) and one yellow (Pantone 116C). The white and yellow triangles are equal in size and their combined width is equal to the width of the black triangle. A third, larger triangle (Pantone 186C) borders the previous three triangles on the remaining two sides, forming an overall shape resembling an arrowhead pointing towards the hoist side.
