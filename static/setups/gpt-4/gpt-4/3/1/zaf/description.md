The flag of South Africa has a unique design with six colors and an aspect ratio of 2:3. Here are the color codes and geometric properties:

1. Red (Pantone 186 C): Hex #E03C31
2. Green (Pantone 3415 C): Hex #007A4D
3. Blue (Pantone 287 C): Hex #001A70
4. Gold (Pantone 1235 C): Hex #FFB612
5. Black: Hex #000000
6. White: Hex #FFFFFF

The flag features a horizontal "Y" shape in green, which starts at the bottom left corner and branches into two arms that extend to the top corners. The "Y" is outlined with thin white stripes. The space between the "Y" and the left edge is filled with red on top and blue on the bottom. A black isosceles triangle is placed over the "Y" on the left side, and the gold color fills the remaining triangular spaces.

Geometrically, the flag can be divided into six horizontal stripes, each occupying 1/6th of the flag's width. The "Y" shape starts at the bottom left corner and extends to the top corners at a 45-degree angle. The thickness of the white borders around the "Y" is 1/48th of the flag's width. The black triangle's sides are equal to the flag's width and height, forming a right-angled triangle.
