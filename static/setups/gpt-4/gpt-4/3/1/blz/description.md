The flag of Belize has an aspect ratio of 3:5. The background consists of horizontal blue (#003F87) stripes at the top and bottom, each occupying one-fifth of the flag's height. The central three-fifths of the flag is a red (#CE1126) stripe with a white circle in the center.

Inside the white circle, there is the national coat of arms surrounded by a green wreath. The coat of arms itself contains various elements, including people, animals, tools, and a shield. However, since you've requested not to include symbolism, I won't describe these elements in detail.

In terms of geometric properties, the diameter of the white circle is equal to half the height of the flag. The red stripe occupies the central 3/5 of the flag's height, while the blue stripes each take up 1/5 of the height.
