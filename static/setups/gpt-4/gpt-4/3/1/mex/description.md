The flag of Mexico has a 4:7 aspect ratio. It is divided vertically into three equal stripes with the following colors and hex codes:

1. Green (left stripe): #006847
2. White (middle stripe): #FFFFFF
3. Red (right stripe): #CE1126

In the center of the white stripe, there's a coat of arms that features an eagle perched on a cactus, holding a snake in its beak and talon. The coat of arms measures 3/8 of the flag's width.

Geometrically, each stripe occupies 1/3 of the flag's width, while the length of the flag is 1.75 times its width.
