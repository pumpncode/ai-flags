The flag of Ireland is a vertical tricolor with three equal bands. The colors and their hexadecimal color codes are:

1. Green (left) - #169B62
2. White (middle) - #FFFFFF
3. Orange (right) - #FF883E

The flag has an aspect ratio of 1:2, meaning its width is twice its height. Geometrically, it can be described as three adjacent rectangles of equal size, each occupying one-third of the flag's total area. Specific measurements depend on the size of the flag being produced; however, the proportions remain constant.
