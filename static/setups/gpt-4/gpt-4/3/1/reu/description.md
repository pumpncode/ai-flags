The flag of Réunion does not have an official design, as it is an overseas department and region of France. Consequently, there is no official color code, aspect ratio, or specific geometric properties for a flag representing Réunion. The French tricolor flag, which has blue (#002395), white (#FFFFFF), and red (#ED2939) vertical stripes with an aspect ratio of 2:3, is often used to represent Réunion as it is part of France.
