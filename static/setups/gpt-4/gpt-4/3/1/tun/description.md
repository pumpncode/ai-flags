The flag of Tunisia has a red background with a white circle in the center. Inside the white circle, there is a red five-pointed star surrounded by a red crescent moon. The color codes are as follows:

- Red: Pantone 186 C (Hex #E30A17)
- White: Pantone Safe (Hex #FFFFFF)

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning its width is two-thirds of its length. The white circle's diameter is equal to 2/5 of the flag's width. The crescent's outer diameter is equal to 3/4 of the diameter of the white circle, while the inner diameter is 1/2 of the white circle's diameter. The five-pointed star is inscribed within an invisible circle, whose diameter is 1/6 of the diameter of the white circle.
