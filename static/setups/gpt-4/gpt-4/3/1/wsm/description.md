The flag of Samoa consists of three main colors: red (#CE1126), white (#FFFFFF), and blue (#002868). It has an aspect ratio of 1:2, meaning the width is twice the length. The flag features a red field with a white-bordered blue canton in the upper hoist-side corner. The blue canton contains the Southern Cross constellation, represented by five white, five-pointed stars. The geometric properties are as follows:

1. The canton's width is half the flag's width (1/2W).
2. The canton's height is one-third of the flag's length (1/3L).
3. The white border around the canton has a width equal to 1/24 of the flag's width (1/24W).
4. The stars are arranged in a rhombus shape, with the largest star in the center.
5. The central star has a diameter equal to 1/6 of the canton's width (1/6 * 1/2W).
6. The other four stars have a diameter equal to 1/8 of the canton's width (1/8 * 1/2W).

These measurements and properties ensure that the flag maintains its proportions and design elements consistently when scaled up or down.
