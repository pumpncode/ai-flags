The flag of Myanmar has three horizontal stripes with the following color codes: yellow (#FECB00) on top, green (#34B233) in the middle, and red (#EA2839) at the bottom. In the top-left corner, there is a large white five-pointed star.

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3. This means its width is 1.5 times its height. The horizontal stripes are equal in size, each occupying one-third of the flag's height. The large white star is centered within the top-left quarter of the flag and spans half the height of the flag.

Unfortunately, I cannot provide exact measurements for the flag's dimensions, as they can vary depending on specific use cases.
