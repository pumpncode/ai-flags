The flag of Tanzania consists of a diagonal black band, bordered by yellow stripes, dividing the field into two triangles. The top triangle is green and the bottom triangle is blue. The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3.

Color codes (hexadecimal):
- Green: #1EB53A
- Yellow: #FCC81D
- Black: #000000
- Blue: #007DBE

Geometric properties:
- The black diagonal band width is 1/6th of the flag's height.
- The yellow stripes bordering the black band are each 1/24th of the flag's height.
- The diagonal band starts at the lower-left corner and ends at the upper-right corner, creating two right-angle triangles.

Measurements:
- Given that the flag's width is "W" units and its height is "H" units, the width of the black band is H/6, and the width of each yellow stripe is H/24.
- For example, if the flag has a width of 90 cm and a height of 60 cm, the black band would be 10 cm wide, and each yellow stripe would be 2.5 cm wide.
