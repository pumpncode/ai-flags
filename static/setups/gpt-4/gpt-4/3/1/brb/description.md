The flag of Barbados has an aspect ratio of 3:2. It consists of three vertical bands with the following color codes and widths:

1. Ultramarine Blue (Pantone 286 C) - width is 1/3 of the flag's length
2. Gold (Pantone 116 C) - width is 1/3 of the flag's length
3. Ultramarine Blue (Pantone 286 C) - width is 1/3 of the flag's length

Within the gold band, there is a black trident head (also called the broken trident) centered vertically and horizontally. The trident head's height is approximately 4/5 of the gold band's width.
