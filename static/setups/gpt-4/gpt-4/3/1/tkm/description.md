The flag of Turkmenistan has a 2:3 aspect ratio. It features a green field with a vertical red stripe on the hoist side, which is one-fourth the width of the flag. The red stripe contains five carpet guls (designs) stacked above two crossed olive branches. To the right of the red stripe, there is a white crescent moon and five white, five-pointed stars in an arc.

Color codes:
- Green: #006A4E
- Red: #DA291C
- White: #FFFFFF

Geometric properties:
- Red stripe: 1/4 width of the flag
- Crescent moon: centered in the green field, to the right of the red stripe
- Five-pointed stars: arranged in an arc, also centered in the green field, with their points facing outward

I cannot provide exact measurements for the elements on the flag, as they may vary depending on the size of the flag being produced. However, the proportions and relative positioning of the elements remain consistent.
