It consists of 14 alternating red (#CC0000) and white (#FFFFFF) horizontal stripes of equal width, with a blue (#010066) canton in the upper hoist-side corner. The canton covers the top seven stripes and is half the length of the flag. Inside the canton, there is a yellow (#FFD700) 14-pointed star and crescent. The star's diameter is 6/10 of the canton's width, while the distance between the star's outer points and the crescent's outer circumference is 1/20 of the canton's width.
