Svalbard and Jan Mayen do not have a unique official flag, as they are territories of Norway. They use the Norwegian flag, which has the following properties:

1. Colors: Red (#C8102E), white (#FFFFFF), and blue (#003896).
2. Aspect ratio: 22:16 (or 11:8).
3. Geometric properties:
   - The flag consists of a red field with a blue Scandinavian cross outlined in white.
   - The vertical bar of the cross is shifted towards the hoist side.
   - The width of each color stripe in the cross is 1/6th of the flag's height.
   - The white border surrounding the blue cross is 1/30th of the flag's height.

These are the main characteristics of the Norwegian flag used by Svalbard and Jan Mayen.
