The flag of Haiti has an aspect ratio of 3:5. It consists of two horizontal bands of equal height. The upper band is blue (Pantone 286 C) and the lower band is red (Pantone 485 C). At the center, there is a white square with a width equal to the height of each band. Inside the white square, there is the Haitian coat of arms. The coat of arms features a palm tree, cannons, flags, and other elements, but since you requested not to include symbolism, I won't go into further detail.
