The flag of Israel has an aspect ratio of 8:11. It consists of three horizontal stripes and a central emblem. The top and bottom stripes are blue (#0038B8) and have a height equal to 1/12 of the flag's total height. The middle stripe is white and contains a blue hexagram, known as the Star of David or Magen David, centered between the two blue stripes. The distance from the top and bottom edges of the flag to the respective blue stripes is also 1/12 of the flag's height.

The hexagram is formed by two equilateral triangles, one pointing up and the other pointing down, with their vertices overlapping. The width of the hexagram is 1/6 of the flag's total width, while its height is 1/6 of the flag's total height. The width of each triangle's base is the same as the hexagram's width.
