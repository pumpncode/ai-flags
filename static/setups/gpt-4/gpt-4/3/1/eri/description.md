The flag of Eritrea has an aspect ratio of 1:2. It consists of three horizontal stripes, with the top and bottom stripes being green (#009543) and light blue (#007FFF), respectively, each occupying 1/4 of the flag's height. The middle stripe is red (#EA0437) and takes up half the flag's height. 

A golden olive branch encircled by a wreath is positioned in the center of the red stripe. On the left side of the flag, within the red stripe, there is a yellow isosceles triangle (#FCD116) with its base at the hoist side and its apex pointing towards the fly side.

The exact geometric properties and measurements of the flag's elements are not standardized; however, the overall design remains consistent.
