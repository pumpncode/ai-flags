The flag of Slovenia has three horizontal stripes and a coat of arms in the upper hoist-side corner. The aspect ratio is 1:2.

Colors:
1. White (top stripe) - HEX #FFFFFF, RGB (255, 255, 255)
2. Blue (middle stripe) - HEX #0033A0, RGB (0, 51, 160)
3. Red (bottom stripe) - HEX #EE1C25, RGB (238, 28, 37)

Each stripe occupies one-third of the flag's height. The coat of arms consists of a white-bordered red shield with a stylized white Mount Triglav (Slovenia's highest peak) and two wavy blue lines representing the Adriatic Sea and local rivers. Above the shield, there are three six-pointed golden stars forming an inverted triangle, which are taken from the Counts of Celje's coat of arms.

There are no specific measurements or geometric properties for the flag other than its aspect ratio and the equal division of stripes.
