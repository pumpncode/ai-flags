The flag of Lesotho has a horizontal tricolor design, with aspect ratio 2:3. The three colors and their respective color codes are:

1. Top stripe - Blue (#003082)
2. Middle stripe - White (#FFFFFF)
3. Bottom stripe - Green (#009543)

The middle white stripe is charged with a black Basotho hat (mokorotlo) symbol in the center. Each stripe occupies one-third of the flag's height.

I cannot provide the exact geometric properties and measurements of the mokorotlo symbol as they may differ depending on the specific rendition of the flag.
