The flag of New Caledonia consists of three horizontal stripes of blue (#00209F), red (#ED1C24), and green (#007A5E) with an aspect ratio of 2:3. On the left side, there is a yellow (#FCD116) circle with a diameter equal to half the flag's width, centered vertically on the blue stripe. Within the yellow circle is a black (#000000) flèche faîtière symbol, which extends from the bottom edge of the circle to the top edge. The flèche faîtière's width is approximately 1/6th of the circle's diameter.
