The flag of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has an aspect ratio of 3:5. It consists of three vertical bands with the following colors and proportions:

1. Blue (Pantone 286C) occupying 1/3 of the flag's length.
2. Yellow (Pantone 116C) occupying 1/3 of the flag's length.
3. Green (Pantone 356C) occupying 1/3 of the flag's length.

In the center of the yellow band, there is a set of three green diamonds arranged in a V-shape. Each diamond is equilateral with sides measuring 1/15 of the flag's width. The diamonds are positioned so that their vertices touch each other, forming a continuous chain. The distance between the top diamond's peak and the upper edge of the yellow band is equal to 1/10 of the flag's width.
