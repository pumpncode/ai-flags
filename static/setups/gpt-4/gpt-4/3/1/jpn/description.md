The flag of Japan, also known as the Nissh≈çki or Hinomaru, has a simple design consisting of a white field with a red circle in the center. The color codes for the flag are:

- White: #FFFFFF
- Red: #BC3F4A

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning its width is two-thirds of its length. The red circle, representing the sun, is centered on the flag and has a diameter equal to three-fifths (3/5) of the flag's length. The distance between the circle's edge and the flag's edges is one-fifth (1/5) of the flag's length on all sides.

For example, if the flag measures 100 cm in length and 66.67 cm in width, the red circle would have a diameter of 60 cm, and it would be positioned 20 cm from each edge of the flag.
