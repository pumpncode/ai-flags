The flag of Mauritania consists of a green field with a golden upward-pointing crescent and a five-pointed star at its center. The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3.

Color codes:
- Green: #006233
- Gold: #FFC400

Geometric properties:
- The circle that circumscribes the crescent has its center at the midpoint of the flag's width and 1/3 of the flag's height from the top edge.
- The radius of this circle is 1/4 of the flag's width.
- The five-pointed star is inscribed within an imaginary circle with the same center as the crescent, and its radius is approximately 1/8 of the flag's width.

Measurements:
- The flag's overall dimensions are determined by the desired size; however, the aspect ratio (2:3) must be maintained. For example, if the flag's width is 3 feet, then its height should be 2 feet.

There are no additional emblems or markings on the flag.
