The flag of Indonesia, known as the "Sang Saka Merah-Putih," consists of two horizontal bands of equal size. The top band is red (color code: #FF0000), and the bottom band is white (color code: #FFFFFF). The flag has an aspect ratio of 2:3, meaning its width is two-thirds of its length. The geometric properties include two rectangles, each occupying half of the flag's area. There are no additional elements, symbols, or measurements on the Indonesian flag.
