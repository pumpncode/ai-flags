The flag of Norway has a red field with a blue Scandinavian cross outlined in white. The color codes for the flag are:

- Red: Pantone 186 C, HEX #C8102E
- Blue: Pantone 282 C, HEX #002A5C
- White: HEX #FFFFFF

The aspect ratio of the flag is 22:16 (width:length). The vertical arm of the cross is centered and extends throughout the entire height of the flag. The horizontal arm is also centered but is shorter, extending to 6/22 of the flag's width on both sides.

The width of the cross is 1/22 of the flag's width, while the white outline around the blue cross is 2/22 of the flag's width. Thus, the total width of the combined blue and white cross is 6/22 of the flag's width.
