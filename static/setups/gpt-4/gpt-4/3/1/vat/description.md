The flag of Vatican City has an aspect ratio of 1:1, making it a square. It consists of two vertical bands of equal width. The left band is yellow (#FFD700) and the right band is white (#FFFFFF). On the white band, there are two crossed keys (one silver/#C0C0C0, one gold/#FFD700) beneath a papal tiara (gold/#FFD700). The keys and tiara are centered in the white band and are proportionally scaled to fit within it.
