The flag of Romania consists of three equal vertical stripes with the following colors from left to right: blue (#002B7F), yellow (#FCD116), and red (#CE1126). The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning its width is two-thirds of its length. Each stripe occupies one-third of the flag's total width. There are no additional geometric properties or measurements on the flag, as it does not feature any symbols, emblems, or other design elements.
