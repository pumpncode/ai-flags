The flag of Vanuatu has an aspect ratio of 3:5. It features a horizontal bicolor design with red (#D21034) on top and green (#007C4E) on the bottom, separated by a black (#000000) horizontal stripe in the middle. The black stripe is outlined by two thin yellow (#FFCC00) stripes.

On the hoist side, there is a black isosceles triangle with its base along the edge of the flag and its apex touching the center of the flag. Inside the triangle, there is a yellow-bordered black circle containing an emblem of a boar's tusk surrounding two crossed fern leaves. The diameter of the circle is approximately one-third of the flag's height.

Unfortunately, exact measurements for the geometric properties of the emblem are not readily available.
