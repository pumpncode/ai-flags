The flag of Mozambique has a 2:3 aspect ratio. It consists of three horizontal stripes, with the top stripe being green (Pantone 356 C), the middle stripe black (Pantone Black C), and the bottom stripe yellow (Pantone 116 C). Each stripe occupies a third of the flag's height. On the left side of the flag, there is a red triangle (Pantone 186 C) that spans the entire height of the flag.

Centered on the red triangle is a white-bordered emblem. The emblem's dimensions are approximately half the width of the red triangle and half the height of the flag. The emblem features a white five-pointed star (Pantone White C), an open book, a hoe, and an AK-47 assault rifle with a bayonet attached to its barrel. The star, book, hoe, and rifle are arranged vertically in that order, and they are all colored in Pantone White C.
