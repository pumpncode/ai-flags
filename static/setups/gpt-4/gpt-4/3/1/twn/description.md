The flag of Taiwan, also known as the Blue Sky with a White Sun and a Wholly Red Earth flag, has an aspect ratio of 2:3. The flag consists of three colors: red (RGB: 255, 0, 0; HEX: #FF0000), blue (RGB: 0, 0, 139; HEX: #00008B), and white (RGB: 255, 255, 255; HEX: #FFFFFF).

The flag can be divided into two parts:

1. The blue canton, which is a rectangle located in the upper hoist-side corner, measuring 2/5 of the flag's total width and the full height. Inside the blue canton, there is a white sun with 12 rays, representing hours of the day and months of the year. The diameter of the sun is 2/5 of the canton height, and the sun is centered both vertically and horizontally within the canton.

2. The red field, occupying the remaining 3/5 of the flag's width and the entire height. The red field is a solid color with no additional design elements.
