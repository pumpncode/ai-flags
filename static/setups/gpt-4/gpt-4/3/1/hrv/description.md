The flag of Croatia has a 1:2 aspect ratio. It consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width, with the following color codes:

1. Top stripe - Red (Pantone 186C / HEX #C8102E)
2. Middle stripe - White (Pantone Safe / HEX #FFFFFF)
3. Bottom stripe - Blue (Pantone 286C / HEX #0033A0)

On the left side of the flag, there is a red and white checkered shield (also known as Å¡ahovnica) with 5 rows and 5 columns, totaling 25 squares. Above the shield are five small coats of arms representing historical regions of Croatia.

The dimensions of the flag elements are not standardized, but typically the height of the shield is approximately half the height of the flag, and the coats of arms above it are proportionally smaller.
