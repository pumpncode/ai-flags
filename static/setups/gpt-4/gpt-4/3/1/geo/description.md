The flag of Georgia consists of a white field with a red St. George's cross (also known as the Georgian Cross) extending to the edges of the flag, and four smaller red bolnur-katskhuri crosses in each of the white quadrants created by the larger cross. Here are some specific details:

1. Colors:
   - Red: Pantone 186 C, HEX #BF0A30, RGB (191,10,48)
   - White: Pantone Safe, HEX #FFFFFF, RGB (255,255,255)

2. Aspect ratio: The flag has an aspect ratio of 2:3, meaning it is twice as long as it is tall.

3. Geometric properties and measurements:
   - The width of each arm of the large St. George's cross is equal to 1/20 of the flag's width.
   - The width of each arm of the small bolnur-katskhuri crosses is equal to 1/25 of the flag's width.
   - The small crosses have their center situated 1/4 of the flag's height from the top and bottom, and 1/4 of the flag's width from the hoist and fly edges.

These specifications should provide you with all the necessary information to recreate the Georgian flag accurately without discussing its symbolism.
