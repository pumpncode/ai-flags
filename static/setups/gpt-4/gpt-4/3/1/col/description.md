The flag of Colombia consists of three horizontal stripes with the following colors and proportions:

1. Yellow (#FFC726) stripe: occupies the top half of the flag and has a width equal to 50% of the flag's height.
2. Blue (#003893) stripe: located below the yellow stripe, with a width equal to 25% of the flag's height.
3. Red (#CE1126) stripe: located below the blue stripe, also with a width equal to 25% of the flag's height.

The flag has an aspect ratio of 2:3, meaning its width is 1.5 times its height. To provide measurements, if the flag's height is 100 units, its width would be 150 units, with the yellow stripe being 50 units high, and both the blue and red stripes being 25 units high each.
