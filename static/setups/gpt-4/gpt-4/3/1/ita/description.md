The flag of Italy consists of three vertical bands of equal width. The colors, from left to right, are green (#009246), white (#F1F2F1), and red (#CE2B37). The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning its width is 1.5 times its height. There are no specific geometric properties or measurements beyond these dimensions, as the flag features a simple tricolor design without any additional elements or symbols.
