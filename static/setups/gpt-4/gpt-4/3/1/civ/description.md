The flag of Ivory Coast consists of three vertical stripes of equal width. From left to right, the colors are orange (#F77F00), white (#FFFFFF), and green (#009E60). The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning that its width is two-thirds of its length. The geometric properties are straightforward, with three vertical rectangles of equal size spanning the entire height and width of the flag. No additional measurements or specific patterns are present on the flag.
