The flag of Libya has a horizontal triband design with the following colors and their respective hex color codes:

1. Red (#E70013) - Top stripe
2. Black (#000000) - Middle stripe
3. Green (#189A18) - Bottom stripe

The middle black stripe is twice the width of the red and green stripes, and it features a white crescent moon and star in its center.

The aspect ratio of the Libyan flag is 1:2, meaning its width is twice its height. The precise geometric properties and measurements may vary depending on the specific flag size being produced.
