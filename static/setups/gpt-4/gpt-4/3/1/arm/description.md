The flag of Armenia consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width. The top stripe is red (#D90012), the middle stripe is blue (#0033A0), and the bottom stripe is orange (#F2A800). The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning it is twice as long as it is tall. The geometric properties are simple, with no additional shapes or designs beyond the three horizontal stripes. The flag's measurements depend on its specific use, but maintaining the 1:2 aspect ratio is essential for accurate representation.
