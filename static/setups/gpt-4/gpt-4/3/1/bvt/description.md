Bouvet Island does not have an official flag, as it is a territory of Norway and not a sovereign nation. The island uses the Norwegian flag, which has the following characteristics:

1. Colors: Red (#EF2B2D), White (#FFFFFF), and Blue (#002868)
2. Aspect ratio: 22:16 (width:length)
3. Geometric properties: A red field with a blue Scandinavian cross outlined in white. The vertical part of the cross is shifted to the hoist side.
4. Measurements: The width of the white stripes is 1/6th the width of the flag, while the blue stripes are 1/4th the width of the white stripes.

As Bouvet Island is a dependency of Norway, it uses the Norwegian flag to represent itself.
