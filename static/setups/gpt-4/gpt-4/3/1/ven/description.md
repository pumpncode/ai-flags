The Venezuelan flag consists of three horizontal stripes and an arc of eight stars in the center. The colors and their respective color codes are as follows:

1. Yellow (top stripe) - Pantone: PMS 116 C / Hex: #FFD700
2. Blue (middle stripe) - Pantone: PMS 286 C / Hex: #0C3C91
3. Red (bottom stripe) - Pantone: PMS 485 C / Hex: #DA291C

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning its width is 1.5 times its height. The yellow stripe occupies half of the flag's height, while the blue and red stripes each occupy a quarter of the flag's height.

The arc of eight white five-pointed stars is located in the blue stripe. Each star is inscribed in an invisible circle with a diameter equal to one-sixteenth of the flag's width. The stars form a convex arc with the highest point at the center of the blue stripe. The distance between the centers of adjacent stars is equal to the diameter of the invisible circles.

The flag may also feature the National Coat of Arms in the upper hoist-side corner, covering part of the yellow and blue stripes.
