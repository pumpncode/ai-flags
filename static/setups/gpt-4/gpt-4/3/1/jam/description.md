The flag of Jamaica has a diagonal cross (saltire) in gold, dividing the field into four triangles. The top and bottom triangles are green, and the left and right triangles are black. Here are the color codes, aspect ratio, and geometric properties:

1. Color Codes:
   - Green: Pantone 356 C, HEX #006B3F, RGB (0,107,63)
   - Gold: Pantone 7409 C, HEX #FEDD00, RGB (254,221,0)
   - Black: Pantone Black C, HEX #000000, RGB (0,0,0)

2. Aspect Ratio: 1:2 (width:length)

3. Geometric Properties:
   - The diagonal cross (saltire) is formed by two equally wide bands that intersect at the center of the flag.
   - The width of each band is 1/12th of the flag's length.
   - The triangles formed by the cross have equal area.

4. Measurements:
   - Since the aspect ratio is 1:2, for any given length, the width will be half of that length.
   - For example, if the length is 6 feet, the width would be 3 feet.

There are no additional emblems or text on the flag.
