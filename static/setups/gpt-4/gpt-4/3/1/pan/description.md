The flag of Panama has four equal squares arranged in a 2x2 pattern, with an aspect ratio of 3:2. The top-left and bottom-right squares are white (color code: #FFFFFF), while the top-right square is blue (#005293) and the bottom-left square is red (#D21034). A diagonal line divides each white square into two equal triangles, with the blue and red colors alternating on either side of the line. The blue triangle's hypotenuse faces the upper hoist-side corner, and the red triangle's hypotenuse faces the lower fly-side corner.
