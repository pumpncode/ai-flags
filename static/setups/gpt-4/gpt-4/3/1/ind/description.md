The flag of India, also known as the Tiranga, has a horizontal rectangular shape with an aspect ratio of 2:3. It consists of three equal horizontal bands:

1. Top band: Saffron (#FF9933)
2. Middle band: White (#FFFFFF)
3. Bottom band: India Green (#138808)

In the center of the white band, there is a 24-spoke wheel in navy blue (#000080) called the Ashoka Chakra. The diameter of the chakra is approximately equal to the width of the white band, and its spokes are evenly spaced.

The flag's dimensions are defined using a grid system. Each band is one-third of the total height (H), and the flag's width (W) is 1.5 times the height. The Ashoka Chakra's diameter is equal to 0.6H, and it is centered on the middle point of the white band.

Here's a summary of the measurements:

1. Aspect ratio: 2:3
2. Height: H
3. Width: 1.5H
4. Each band height: H/3
5. Ashoka Chakra diameter: 0.6H
