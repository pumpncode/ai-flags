The flag of North Korea consists of three horizontal stripes and a red star inside a white circle. The color codes are:

1. Red: #ED1C27
2. White: #FFFFFF
3. Blue: #024FAF

The flag has an aspect ratio of 1:2, meaning its width is twice its height. The three horizontal stripes are composed of two blue bands (top and bottom) and one red band in the middle. The blue bands each occupy 1/6 of the flag's height, while the red band occupies 2/6 of the flag's height. The white circle is centered on the red stripe and has a diameter equal to 4/6 of the flag's height; the red star within the circle has five points and is inscribed in an invisible circle with a diameter equal to 2/6 of the flag's height.
