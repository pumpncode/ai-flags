The flag of Uganda has an aspect ratio of 2:3. It consists of six horizontal stripes with the following colors and their respective HEX color codes:

1. Black (#000000)
2. Yellow (#FCD116)
3. Red (#CE1126)
4. Black (#000000)
5. Yellow (#FCD116)
6. Red (#CE1126)

At the center of the flag, there is a white circle with a diameter equal to 6/11 of the flag's height. Inside the circle, there is a grey crowned crane with one leg raised, standing on one black leg. The crane is facing the hoist side and has a white tuft of feathers on its head. Its beak and legs are yellow, and it has red inflatable throat sacs. The crane also holds a white ribbon in its raised foot.

The exact geometric properties and measurements of the crane and its elements are not standardized, but they should be proportionate to the flag's dimensions.
