- The distance between the canoe and the top edge is 1/6 of the flag's width.
- The diameter of each star is 1/24 of the flag's length.

The stars are arranged in a rectangle, with two stars on the top row and two on the bottom row:
- The distance between the top stars is 1/12 of the flag's length.
- The distance between the bottom stars is 1/6 of the flag's length.
- The distance between the rows of stars is 1/12 of the flag's width.
