The flag of Ecuador consists of three horizontal stripes with the colors yellow, blue, and red. The aspect ratio is 2:3. The yellow stripe occupies half of the flag's width, while the blue and red stripes each occupy a quarter.

Color codes:
- Yellow: Pantone 116 C, HEX #FFD700
- Blue: Pantone 286 C, HEX #0038A8
- Red: Pantone 186 C, HEX #CE1126

There is also a coat of arms placed on the blue stripe, towards the hoist side, but since you asked not to include symbolism, I won't describe it in detail.
