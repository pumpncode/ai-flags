The flag of Albania features a black, double-headed eagle on a red background. The color codes for the flag are:

- Red: #CE1126
- Black: #000000

The aspect ratio of the flag is 5:7, which means the width is 5 units and the length is 7 units. The double-headed eagle is centered on the flag and occupies most of the space, with its wings spread wide and heads facing opposite directions. The eagle's design is based on a Byzantine emblem.

Unfortunately, precise geometric properties and measurements of the eagle are not standardized, as variations in the design exist.
