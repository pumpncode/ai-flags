The flag of Niger consists of three horizontal stripes and an orange circle in the center. The top stripe is orange (#E05206), the middle stripe is white (#FFFFFF), and the bottom stripe is green (#169B62). The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning it is twice as long as it is tall. The width of each stripe is equal, taking up one-third of the flag's height. The orange circle is centered on the white stripe and has a diameter equal to half the height of the flag.
