The flag of the Caribbean Netherlands, also known as the BES Islands (Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba), does not have a single unified flag representing all three islands. Instead, each island has its own distinct flag. Here are the descriptions for each:

Bonaire:
- Colors: Blue (#0033A0), Yellow (#FFD700), Red (#CE1126), White (#FFFFFF)
- Aspect ratio: 2:3
- Description: A blue field with a horizontal yellow stripe in the middle and a red triangle on the hoist side. The yellow stripe has a white compass rose.

Sint Eustatius:
- Colors: Blue (#002868), Red (#BF0A30), White (#FFFFFF), Gold (#FCD116)
- Aspect ratio: 2:3
- Description: A horizontal tricolor flag with blue on top, red in the middle, and white at the bottom. On the left side of the flag, there is a golden diamond with a five-pointed star.

Saba:
- Colors: Blue (#0067C6), Red (#ED1B2E), White (#FFFFFF), Gold (#FDB913)
- Aspect ratio: 2:3
- Description: A horizontal tricolor flag with blue on top, red in the middle, and white at the bottom. A gold five-pointed star is located in the center of the red stripe.

As each island has its own flag, the geometric properties, measurements, and other relevant information vary between them.
