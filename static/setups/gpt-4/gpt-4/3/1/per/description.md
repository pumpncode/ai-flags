The flag of Peru has a vertical triband design with the following colors and color codes:

1. Red (#D91023)
2. White (#FFFFFF)
3. Red (#D91023)

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning that its width is 2 units while its height is 3 units. The two red bands are equal in size and placed at the hoist and fly ends, while the white band is situated in the middle. Each band occupies one-third of the flag's width.

Exact measurements and geometric properties depend on the specific flag size being produced, but the proportions remain constant.
