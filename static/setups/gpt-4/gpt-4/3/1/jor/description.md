The flag of Jordan consists of three horizontal stripes and a red equilateral triangle on the hoist side. The aspect ratio is 1:2. The colors and their respective hex color codes are:

1. Black (top stripe) - #000000
2. White (middle stripe) - #FFFFFF
3. Green (bottom stripe) - #007A3D
4. Red (triangle) - #CE1126

Each of the horizontal stripes occupies one-third of the flag's width, while the red triangle extends from the hoist side to the center of the flag. The triangle's base is along the hoist and has a length equal to half the flag's width.
