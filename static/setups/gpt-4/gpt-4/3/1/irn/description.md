The flag of Iran has an aspect ratio of 4:7 and consists of three horizontal stripes of equal height. The color codes for the stripes are as follows:

1. Top stripe: Green (#008000)
2. Middle stripe: White (#FFFFFF)
3. Bottom stripe: Red (#FF0000)

Between the green and white stripes, there are 22 copies of the "Allah" ligature (الله) in the Kufic script, repeated in a continuous line. Between the white and red stripes, the same pattern is mirrored.

At the center of the white stripe, there is a stylized emblem called the "Takbir" which resembles a geometrically symmetric tulip. This emblem measures 1/4th of the flag's width.

The flag design adheres to precise geometric properties and measurements, ensuring symmetry and balance in the overall layout.
