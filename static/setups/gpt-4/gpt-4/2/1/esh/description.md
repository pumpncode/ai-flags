The flag of Western Sahara consists of three horizontal stripes and a red triangle on the hoist side. The top stripe is black, the middle one is white, and the bottom one is green. The red triangle has its base along the hoist side and its apex at the center of the flag.

Color codes:
- Black: #000000
- White: #FFFFFF
- Green: #007A3D
- Red: #CE1126

The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning its width is twice its height. The horizontal stripes are equal in size, each occupying one-third of the flag's height. The red triangle extends from the hoist side to the midpoint of the flag's length.

Exact measurements and geometric properties may vary depending on the specific flag production, but these are the general characteristics of the Western Sahara flag.
