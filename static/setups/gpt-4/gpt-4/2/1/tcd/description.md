The flag of Chad consists of three vertical stripes of equal width. The colors and their respective hex color codes are:

1. Blue (left stripe): #002664
2. Yellow (middle stripe): #FECB00
3. Red (right stripe): #C60C30

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning its width is two-thirds of its length. Since the stripes are of equal width, each occupies one-third of the flag's width. There are no specific measurements for the flag, as it can be scaled up or down while maintaining the aspect ratio and proportions.

No other geometric properties or measurements are present in the flag's design.
