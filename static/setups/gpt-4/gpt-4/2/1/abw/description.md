The flag of Aruba has an aspect ratio of 2:3. It consists of a blue field (Pantone 280C) with two narrow yellow stripes (Pantone 116C) at the bottom, and a red four-pointed star (Pantone 186C) outlined in white (Pantone White) in the upper hoist-side corner.

The blue field covers the entire flag, while the two yellow stripes are parallel to each other and placed near the bottom edge. Each stripe is 1/16th of the flag's width, and they are separated by a gap of 1/16th of the flag's width.

The red star has a white outline that is 1/48th of the flag's width. The star's points are equidistant from each other, forming a square with diagonals parallel to the flag's edges. The distance between the star's opposite points is equal to 1/4th of the flag's width. The star is positioned such that its top point is 1/8th of the flag's width away from the top edge, and its left point is 1/8th of the flag's width away from the hoist edge.
