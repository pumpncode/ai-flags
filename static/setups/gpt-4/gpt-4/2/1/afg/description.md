The flag of Afghanistan has three equal vertical stripes with the colors black (#000000), red (#BF0A30), and green (#00966E). In the center of the red stripe, there is a national emblem in white. The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning its width is two-thirds of its length. The emblem consists of a mosque with a pulpit and flags on either side, below the mosque, Eastern Arabic numerals for the solar year 1298 (1919 in the Gregorian calendar, the year of Afghan independence from the UK); this central image is circled by a border consisting of sheaves of wheat on the left and right, in the upper-center is an Arabic inscription "الله أكبر" (Allahu Akbar, "God is [the] greatest") and below which are rays of the rising sun.
