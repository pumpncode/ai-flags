The flag of Angola has two horizontal bands of red (#CE1126) and black (#000000) of equal size, with a centered yellow emblem. The emblem consists of a partial cogwheel, a machete, and a five-pointed star. The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3.

Unfortunately, I cannot provide specific measurements for the geometric properties of the emblem, as they can vary depending on the size of the flag.
