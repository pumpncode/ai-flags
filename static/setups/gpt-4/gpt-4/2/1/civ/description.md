The flag of Ivory Coast consists of three vertical stripes of equal width. The colors and their respective hex color codes are:

1. Orange (#F77F00) - left stripe
2. White (#FFFFFF) - middle stripe
3. Green (#009E60) - right stripe

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning its width is two-thirds of its length. There are no specific geometric properties or measurements beyond the equal width of the stripes.
