The flag of the Netherlands consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width. The colors and their respective hex color codes are:

1. Red (top stripe) - #AE1C28
2. White (middle stripe) - #FFFFFF
3. Blue (bottom stripe) - #21468B

The flag has an aspect ratio of 2:3, meaning its width is 2 units and its height is 3 units. Since the stripes are of equal width, each stripe measures one-third of the flag's height. There are no other geometric properties or measurements on the flag.
