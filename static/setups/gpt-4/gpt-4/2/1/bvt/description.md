Bouvet Island is an uninhabited Norwegian dependency, and it does not have a unique flag of its own. Instead, it uses the flag of Norway, which has the following properties:

1. Colors: Red (#EF2B2D), White (#FFFFFF), and Blue (#002868)
2. Aspect ratio: 22:16 (or 11:8)
3. Geometric properties: The flag consists of a red field with a blue Scandinavian cross outlined in white. The vertical arm of the cross is shifted towards the hoist side.
4. Measurements: The width of the white and blue stripes on the cross are 1/6 and 1/18 of the flag's height, respectively. The distance from the hoist to the cross is 1/6 of the flag's length.

As Bouvet Island doesn't have its own flag, there is no specific symbolism associated with it.
