The flag of Norway consists of a red field with a blue Scandinavian cross outlined in white. The color codes for the flag are:

- Red: Pantone 186 C, HEX #EF2B2D
- Blue: Pantone 281 C, HEX #002868
- White: HEX #FFFFFF

The aspect ratio of the Norwegian flag is 22:16 (width to length). The cross has a vertical and horizontal arm, both of which are divided into three equal-width stripes: white, blue, and white. The width of the cross is 1/6th of the flag's height.

The geometric properties and measurements of the flag are as follows:

- The vertical arm of the cross starts 6 units from the hoist side and extends 2 units in width.
- The horizontal arm of the cross starts 6 units from the top edge and extends 2 units in height.
- The total width of the flag is 22 units, while the total length is 16 units.

These measurements ensure that the cross remains proportional and centered on the flag.
