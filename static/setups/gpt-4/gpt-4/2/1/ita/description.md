The flag of Italy, also known as the "Tricolore," consists of three vertical stripes of equal width. The colors and their respective hex color codes are:

1. Green (left stripe) - #009246
2. White (middle stripe) - #FFFFFF
3. Red (right stripe) - #CE2B37

The flag has an aspect ratio of 2:3, meaning its width is two-thirds of its length. There are no specific geometric properties or measurements beyond the equal-width stripes and the aspect ratio.
