The flag of the Falkland Islands has an aspect ratio of 1:2. It consists of a blue field (Pantone 300) with the Union Jack in the canton and the Falkland Islands coat of arms in the fly half.

The Union Jack is composed of red (Pantone 186), white, and blue (Pantone 280). The coat of arms features a white disk with a blue border (Pantone 300) containing the text "FALKLAND ISLANDS" in black capital letters. Inside the disk is a shield with a sky-blue field (Pantone 300) and a ship, a ram, and grassy ground in natural colors. Above the shield is a crest with a naval crown and a sea lion holding a torch, both in natural colors.

Exact geometric properties and measurements are not standardized for the flag, but the elements should be proportionally sized to fit within the 1:2 aspect ratio.
