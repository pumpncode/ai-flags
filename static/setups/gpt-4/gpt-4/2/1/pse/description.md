The flag of Palestine consists of four horizontal stripes and a red triangle on the hoist side. The colors are:

1. Black (top stripe) - HEX #000000
2. White (second stripe) - HEX #FFFFFF
3. Green (third stripe) - HEX #007A3D
4. Red (bottom stripe and triangle) - HEX #CE1126

The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning its width is twice its height. Each of the four horizontal stripes occupies 1/4th of the flag's height. The red triangle extends from the hoist side to the center of the flag, with its base along the entire hoist side and its apex at the midpoint of the fly side.

Exact measurements depend on the size of the flag being produced, but the proportions remain consistent.
