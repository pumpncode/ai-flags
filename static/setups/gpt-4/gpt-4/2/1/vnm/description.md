The flag of Vietnam consists of a red background with a large, centered yellow five-pointed star. The color codes for the flag are:

- Red: #DA251D
- Yellow: #FFCD21

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning its width is two units and its height is three units. The geometric properties and measurements of the flag include:

1. The distance between each point of the star and the center of the star is equal to 3/10 of the flag's width.
2. The distance between the center of the star and the midpoint of each side of the star is equal to 1/20 of the flag's width.
3. The distance between the center of the star and the midpoint of the flag is equal to 1/2 of the flag's height.

These measurements ensure that the star is proportionally sized and positioned within the flag.
