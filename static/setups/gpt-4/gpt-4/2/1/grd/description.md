The flag of Grenada has an aspect ratio of 3:5. It consists of four horizontal stripes, with the top and bottom stripes being red (#CE1126) and the middle two stripes being yellow (#FCD116). The yellow stripes are twice as wide as the red stripes. A green (#007A5E) isosceles triangle borders the left side of the flag, with its base along the hoist and its apex at the center of the flag.

In the center of the flag, there is a red circle with a diameter equal to half the height of the flag. Inside the circle, there is a yellow-bordered seven-pointed star with a diameter equal to one-third of the flag's height. The star is centered within the circle.

On the outer edge of the red circle, there are six smaller yellow five-pointed stars arranged in a hexagonal pattern. Each small star has a diameter equal to one-twelfth of the flag's height. The distance between the centers of adjacent small stars is equal to one-sixth of the flag's height.
