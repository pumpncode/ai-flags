The flag of Bhutan has a 2:3 aspect ratio. It is diagonally divided into two halves, with the upper half being yellow (Pantone 116 C) and the lower half being orange (Pantone 165 C). At the center of the flag, there is a white dragon (Druk) facing right, outlined in black.

The diagonal division forms a hypotenuse that runs from the lower hoist-side corner to the upper fly-side corner. The dragon is centered along this line and extends approximately 60% of the flag's width. The dragon's height is roughly equal to half the flag's height.
