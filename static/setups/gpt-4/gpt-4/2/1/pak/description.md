The flag of Pakistan has an aspect ratio of 2:3. It consists of a dark green field (Pantone 342 C) with a vertical white stripe on the hoist side, which occupies one-fourth of the total width. In the center of the green field, there is a white crescent moon and a five-pointed star.

The geometric properties and measurements are as follows:
1. The width of the white stripe is 1/4th of the flag's total width.
2. The diameter of the circle enclosing the crescent is 3/5th of the width of the green field.
3. The distance between the center of the circle and the hoist edge is half the width of the green field.
4. The five-pointed star is inscribed in a circle with a diameter of 1/10th of the flag's length.
5. The center of the star is located on the circumference of the circle enclosing the crescent, and its top point aligns with the circle's center.

These elements combine to create the distinctive design of the Pakistani flag.
