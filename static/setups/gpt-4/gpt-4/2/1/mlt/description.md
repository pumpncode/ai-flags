The flag of Malta consists of two vertical bands of equal width. The left band is white (color code: #FFFFFF), and the right band is red (color code: #CF142B). The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning its width is 1.5 times its height. In the top-left corner, there is a gray-bordered representation of the George Cross (color code: #7A7A7A) on a light gray background (color code: #CCCCCC). The cross is centered in a square with sides equal to one-third of the flag's height.
