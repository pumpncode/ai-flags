The flag of South Africa has a horizontal Y-shaped design with six colors. The aspect ratio is 2:3. Here are the color codes and geometric properties:

1. Black (Pantone Black C): Upper left triangle, extending to the center of the flag.
2. Yellow (Pantone 116 C): Horizontal band above the black triangle, width equal to 1/6th of the flag's height.
3. Green (Pantone 3415 C): Y-shaped band, dividing the flag into two triangles and four horizontal bands. The width of the green band is 1/6th of the flag's height.
4. White: Thin borders on either side of the green band, each with a width equal to 1/48th of the flag's height.
5. Red (Pantone 186 C): Upper right triangle, extending to the center of the flag.
6. Blue (Pantone 287 C): Lower triangle, occupying the bottom half of the flag.

The Y-shape converges at the center of the flag, where the arms of the Y meet at an angle of 45 degrees. The length of the flag is divided into three equal parts by the horizontal arms of the Y.
