The flag of Switzerland is a square with an aspect ratio of 1:1. It has a red background (Pantone 485 C) and features a white cross in the center. The cross consists of a horizontal and vertical band, each with equal width, intersecting at their midpoints. The arms of the cross are of equal length, extending to the edges of the flag.

Each arm of the cross is divided into two equal rectangles, creating a total of four rectangles per arm. The width of the cross arms is 1/6th the height of the flag. The distance between the rectangles on the same arm is also 1/6th the height of the flag.
