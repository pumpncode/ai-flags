The flag of Hungary consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width, with the colors red (#CD2A3E), white (#FFFFFF), and green (#436F4D). The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning its width is twice its height. The geometric properties include three rectangles, each occupying one-third of the flag's height. There are no specific measurements for the flag, as it can be scaled proportionally based on the desired size while maintaining the aspect ratio and color proportions.
