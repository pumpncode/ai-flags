The flag of Syria consists of three horizontal stripes and two stars within the middle stripe. The color codes for the flag are:

1. Red (top stripe): #CE1126
2. White (middle stripe): #FFFFFF
3. Black (bottom stripe): #000000
4. Green (stars): #007A3D

The aspect ratio of the Syrian flag is 2:3, meaning its width is 2 units and its height is 3 units. The white stripe contains two green five-pointed stars, which are positioned horizontally next to each other. Each star's diameter is approximately 1/6th of the flag's height, and they are separated by a distance equal to their diameter.

The geometric properties of the flag include:

1. The width of each horizontal stripe is equal, with each stripe occupying 1/3rd of the flag's height.
2. The stars are inscribed in an invisible circle, with the center of each star being the center of the circle.
3. The stars' points are equally spaced around the circumference of the circle, with each point being 72 degrees apart from its neighbors.

These measurements and properties should provide a comprehensive description of the Syrian flag without delving into its symbolism.
