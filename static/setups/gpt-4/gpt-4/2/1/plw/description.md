The flag of Palau consists of a light blue field (#4AADD6) with a large yellow circle (#FFDE00) slightly off-centered towards the hoist side. The aspect ratio of the flag is 5:8, meaning its width is 1.6 times its height. The diameter of the yellow circle is approximately half the height of the flag.
