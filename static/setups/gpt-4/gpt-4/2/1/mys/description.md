The flag of Malaysia, also known as the Jalur Gemilang, has an aspect ratio of 1:2. It consists of 14 alternating red (#CC0000) and white (#FFFFFF) horizontal stripes of equal width, with a blue (#010066) canton in the upper hoist-side corner. The canton occupies the area of seven stripes and has a width of half the flag's length.

Inside the blue canton, there is a yellow (#FFCC00) 14-pointed star (the Bintang Persekutuan) and a yellow crescent moon facing the fly side. The star's points are uniform, and the circle circumscribing it has a diameter equal to 6/15 of the canton's width. The distance between the star's outermost points and the canton's edges is 1/30 of the flag's width. The crescent's inner circle has a diameter of 2/5 of the canton's width, while its outer circle has a diameter of 1/2 of the canton's width.
