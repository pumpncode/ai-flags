The flag of Saint Barth√©lemy consists of three horizontal stripes: blue (#002395) on top, white (#FFFFFF) in the middle, and red (#ED2939) at the bottom. The aspect ratio is 2:3. In the upper left corner, there is a white square with a red Maltese cross inside it. The height of the square is equal to the height of the blue stripe. The Maltese cross has four arrow-shaped arms, each pointing outwards from the center. The width of each arm is equal to one-third of the square's side length.
