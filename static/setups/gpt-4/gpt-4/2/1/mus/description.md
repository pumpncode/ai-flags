The flag of Mauritius consists of four horizontal stripes of equal width. The colors and their respective hex color codes are:

1. Top stripe: Red (#DC241F)
2. Second stripe: Blue (#00209F)
3. Third stripe: Yellow (#FFD500)
4. Bottom stripe: Green (#009E60)

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning its width is two units while its height is three units. Since the stripes are of equal width, each stripe occupies a height of 0.75 units (3 units divided by 4). Other than these details, there are no specific geometric properties or measurements for the flag.
