The top stripe is black (color code: #000000), the middle stripe is white (color code: #FFFFFF), and the bottom stripe is green (color code: #007A3D). The red triangle (color code: #CE1126) extends from the hoist to the center of the flag, with its base along the hoist edge and its apex touching the free edge.
