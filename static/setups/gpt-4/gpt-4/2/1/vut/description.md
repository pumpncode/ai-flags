The flag of Vanuatu has an aspect ratio of 3:2. It consists of two horizontal stripes, with the top stripe being red (#D21034) and the bottom stripe being green (#007B48). On the left side, there is a black triangle (#000000) with its base on the hoist side and its apex at the center of the flag. Within the black triangle, there is a yellow-bordered black emblem called a Y-shape or boomerang shape.

The emblem's border is yellow (#FCD116), and it starts from the lower-left corner of the triangle, goes up to the center, and then splits into two branches that extend to the upper-left and upper-right corners of the triangle. Inside the black triangle, there are two yellow-bordered black circles placed horizontally next to each other, representing the chain of islands in Vanuatu.

Exact measurements and geometric properties may vary depending on the specific flag manufacturer or official guidelines.
