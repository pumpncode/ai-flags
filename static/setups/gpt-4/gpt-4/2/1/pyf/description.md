The flag of French Polynesia consists of three horizontal stripes with the following color codes:

1. Red (top stripe): #ED2939
2. White (middle stripe): #FFFFFF
3. Red (bottom stripe): #ED2939

The middle white stripe is twice the height of each red stripe. The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning its width is 1.5 times its height.

In the center of the white stripe, there is a circular emblem with a diameter equal to half the height of the white stripe. The emblem has a red outer ring (#ED2939) and a white inner circle (#FFFFFF). Inside the white circle, there are five stylized, interconnected red (#ED2939) triangles forming a pentagon-like shape.
