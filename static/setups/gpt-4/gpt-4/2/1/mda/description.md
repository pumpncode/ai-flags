The flag of Moldova has a vertical tricolor design with equal stripes of blue (#0046AE), yellow (#FFD200), and red (#C1272D). The aspect ratio is 1:2, meaning the width is twice the length. In the center of the yellow stripe, there is the Moldovan coat of arms, which features an eagle holding a shield, a scepter, and an orb. The coat of arms is not symmetrically placed; it is shifted towards the hoist side. The exact dimensions and placement of the coat of arms may vary, but typically, its height is half the width of the flag.
