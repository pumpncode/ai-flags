The flag of Peru consists of three vertical stripes: red (#D91023), white (#FFFFFF), and red (#D91023). The aspect ratio is 2:3, meaning the flag's width is two units while its height is three units. The width of each stripe is equal, so each stripe occupies one-third of the flag's total width. There are no specific geometric properties or measurements beyond these basic elements.
