The flag of Croatia has a horizontal tricolor design with three equal bands of red (#FF0000), white (#FFFFFF), and blue (#0000FF) from top to bottom. The aspect ratio is 1:2.

In the center-left part of the flag, there is a shield-shaped coat of arms. The coat of arms consists of a red and white checkerboard pattern (25 alternating squares) called "šahovnica." Above the šahovnica, there are five smaller shields representing historical regions of Croatia. From left to right, they represent the oldest known Croatian coat of arms, Dubrovnik, Dalmatia, Istria, and Slavonia.

The exact geometric properties and measurements of the flag elements may vary slightly depending on the specific flag manufacturer or official guidelines.
