The flag of Seychelles has a unique design consisting of five oblique bands of different colors, which radiate from the bottom left corner to the top right corner. The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2.

Here are the color codes and geometric properties:

1. Blue (top-left band): Pantone 300 C; RGB(0, 102, 204); Hex #0066CC
2. Yellow (top-right band): Pantone 116 C; RGB(255, 204, 0); Hex #FFCC00
3. Red (middle band): Pantone 186 C; RGB(204, 0, 0); Hex #CC0000
4. White (bottom-left band): Pantone White; RGB(255, 255, 255); Hex #FFFFFF
5. Green (bottom-right band): Pantone 347 C; RGB(0, 153, 51); Hex #009933

Each band's width varies as they radiate outwards. The blue band starts at the bottom left corner with zero width and expands to cover approximately 1/6th of the flag's length at the top right corner. Similarly, the yellow, red, white, and green bands expand in width as they progress from the bottom left to the top right corner. The red band, being the central one, covers roughly 1/3rd of the flag's length at the top right corner.
