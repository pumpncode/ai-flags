The flag of Nigeria consists of three vertical stripes of equal width. The aspect ratio is 1:2, meaning the flag's width is twice its height. The color codes for the stripes are as follows:

- Green (left stripe): Pantone 347 C, HEX #008751
- White (middle stripe): HEX #FFFFFF
- Green (right stripe): Pantone 347 C, HEX #008751

There is no specific measurement for the flag, but the geometric properties remain consistent with the aspect ratio and equal-width stripes.
