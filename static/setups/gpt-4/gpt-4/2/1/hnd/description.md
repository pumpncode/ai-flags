The flag of Honduras consists of three horizontal stripes with the following color codes:

1. Top stripe: Blue (Pantone 286 C, Hex #0038A8)
2. Middle stripe: White (Pantone White, Hex #FFFFFF)
3. Bottom stripe: Blue (Pantone 286 C, Hex #0038A8)

The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning its width is twice its height.

In the center of the white stripe, there are five blue, five-pointed stars arranged in an X pattern. The stars have a diameter equal to 1/6th of the flag's height and are equidistant from each other and the edges of the white stripe.

The flag does not have any specific geometric properties or measurements beyond these details.
