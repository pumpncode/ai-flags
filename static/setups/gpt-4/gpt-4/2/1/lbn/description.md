The flag of Lebanon has an aspect ratio of 2:3. It consists of three horizontal stripes and a green cedar tree emblem at the center. The top and bottom stripes are red (#ED1C24) and have equal width, while the middle stripe is white (#FFFFFF) and is twice as wide as the red stripes. The green cedar tree (#007A3D) is located in the middle of the white stripe, with its top touching the upper red stripe and its base touching the lower red stripe. The cedar tree's height is half the flag's width, and its width is one-third of the flag's width.
