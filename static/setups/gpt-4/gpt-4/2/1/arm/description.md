The flag of Armenia consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width. The top stripe is red (#D90012), the middle stripe is blue (#0033A0), and the bottom stripe is orange (#F2A800). The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning its width is twice its height. There are no specific geometric properties or measurements beyond the equal width of the stripes and the aspect ratio.
