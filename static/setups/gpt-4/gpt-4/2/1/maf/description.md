The flag of Saint Martin doesn't have an official design, as the island is divided into two territories: the French Collectivity of Saint Martin and the Dutch Sint Maarten. Each territory has its own flag.

1. Flag of the French Collectivity of Saint Martin:
- Aspect ratio: 2:3
- Colors: Blue (#002395), White (#FFFFFF), Red (#ED2939), Green (#007A5E), Yellow (#FCD116)
- Design: A horizontal tricolor of blue, white, and red stripes with the coat of arms in the center. The coat of arms features a shield with a green chevron, yellow sun, and three fleurs-de-lis on a blue field, surrounded by a white border with the words "Collectivit√© de Saint-Martin."

2. Flag of Sint Maarten (Dutch side):
- Aspect ratio: 2:3
- Colors: Red (#D21034), White (#FFFFFF), Blue (#21468B), Yellow (#F6AE15)

The coat of arms features a brown shield with a yellow-bordered blue diamond, a pelican, and a rising sun above the sea, all surrounded by a yellow ribbon with the motto "Semper Progrediens" (Always Progressing).
