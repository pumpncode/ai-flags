The flag of Timor-Leste has an aspect ratio of 1:2. It consists of four colors: red (#FF0000), black (#000000), yellow (#FFCC00), and white (#FFFFFF). The flag is divided into two triangles, with the larger one being black and the smaller one being red. A yellow isosceles triangle overlays both triangles, with its base along the hoist side. Centered within the black triangle is a white five-pointed star.

The flag's geometric properties are as follows:
1. The black triangle has a right angle at the lower hoist-side corner and extends to the midpoint of the fly side.
2. The red triangle has a right angle at the upper fly-side corner and extends to the midpoint of the hoist side.
3. The yellow triangle has its base along the hoist side, extending from the top to the bottom, and its apex touching the midpoint of the fly side.
4. The white star is equidistant from the edges of the black triangle, with one point directed towards the upper hoist-side corner.

Exact measurements for the flag elements depend on the size of the flag being produced.
