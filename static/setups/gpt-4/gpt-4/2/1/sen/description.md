The flag of Senegal consists of three vertical stripes of equal width, with the colors green (#008000), yellow (#FFD700), and red (#FF0000) from left to right. At the center of the red stripe, there is a green five-pointed star. The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning its width is two-thirds of its length. The geometric properties include the three equal-width vertical stripes and the regular five-pointed star. Measurements depend on the specific flag size being used, but the proportions remain constant.
