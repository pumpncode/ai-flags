The flag of Libya has a horizontal triband design with the following colors and their respective HEX color codes:

1. Red (#E70013) - top stripe
2. Black (#000000) - middle stripe
3. Green (#189A18) - bottom stripe

The black stripe in the center is twice as wide as the red and green stripes. The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning its width is twice its height. There are no specific geometric properties or measurements beyond the aspect ratio and the proportion of the stripes.
