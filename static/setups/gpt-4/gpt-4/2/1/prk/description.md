The flag of North Korea consists of three horizontal stripes and a red star within a white circle on the left side. The color codes are:

1. Red: #ED1C27
2. White: #FFFFFF
3. Blue: #024FA2

The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning its width is twice its height. The flag's design can be described as follows:

1. A blue stripe at the top and bottom, each occupying 1/6th of the flag's height.
2. A white stripe between each blue stripe and the central red stripe, each occupying 1/25th of the flag's height.
3. A red stripe in the center, occupying 13/25ths of the flag's height.
4. A white circle with a diameter of 2/5ths of the flag's height, positioned in the middle of the red stripe and centered at 1/2 of the flag's height.
5. A red five-pointed star inside the white circle, with its center at 1/2 of the flag's height and 1/4 of the flag's width. The star's circumscribed circle has a diameter of 3/10ths of the flag's height.

These geometric properties and measurements describe the flag of North Korea without delving into its symbolism.
