The flag of Iran has an aspect ratio of 4:7. It consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width, with the colors green (#008000) on top, white (#FFFFFF) in the middle, and red (#FF0000) at the bottom. The national emblem, a stylized representation of the word "Allah," is centered on the white stripe and has a red color (#FF0000). The emblem measures 1/6th of the flag's width.

On the inner edges of the green and red stripes, there are 22 copies of the phrase "Allahu Akbar" (God is the greatest) written in Kufic script, forming a continuous line. The script is white (#FFFFFF) on the green stripe and red (#FF0000) on the white stripe. The height of each "Allahu Akbar" is 1/12th of the flag's width.
