The flag of Ethiopia consists of three horizontal stripes and a central emblem. The aspect ratio is 1:2.

Colors:
1. Green (top stripe): Pantone 347 C, HEX #008751
2. Yellow (middle stripe): Pantone 116 C, HEX #FCD116
3. Red (bottom stripe): Pantone 186 C, HEX #CE1126
4. Blue (emblem background): Pantone 300 C, HEX #002395

Stripes:
Each stripe has equal height, occupying one-third of the flag's total height.

Emblem:
Located at the center of the flag, the emblem is a blue circle with a yellow pentagram and single rays of light emitting from the star's vertices. The diameter of the circle is half the height of the flag.

Measurements:
Since the aspect ratio is 1:2, if the flag's height is 'h', then its width would be '2h'. Each stripe's height would be 'h/3', and the emblem's diameter would be 'h/2'.
