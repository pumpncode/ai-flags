The flag of Ghana consists of three horizontal stripes and a black star in the center. The aspect ratio is 1:2, meaning the width is twice the length. Here are the color codes and geometric properties:

1. Top stripe: Red (Pantone 186 C, HEX #CE1126)
2. Middle stripe: Yellow (Pantone 116 C, HEX #FCD116)
3. Bottom stripe: Green (Pantone 347 C, HEX #006B3F)
4. Black Star: Pantone Black C, HEX #000000

Each stripe occupies one-third of the flag's height. The black star is centered on the yellow stripe and has a size that is approximately half the height of the yellow stripe.
