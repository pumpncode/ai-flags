The flag of Tokelau consists of a blue field with a yellow stylized Tokelauan canoe (vaka) and four white stars. The color codes for the flag are:

- Blue: #00247D
- Yellow: #FCD116
- White: #FFFFFF

The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning its width is twice its height. The geometric properties and measurements of the flag elements are not standardized, so they may vary slightly in different representations.
