The flag of Canada, also known as the Maple Leaf, has an aspect ratio of 1:2. It consists of two vertical red bands (Pantone 186C) on the hoist and fly ends, with a white square (Pantone White) in the center containing a stylized 11-pointed red maple leaf (Pantone 186C). The red bands have a width of 1/4 the flag's length each, while the white square has a width equal to the flag's height.

In terms of geometric properties, the maple leaf is symmetrical along its vertical axis. The leaf's base starts at the midpoint of the white square's bottom edge, and its top point reaches the midpoint of the white square's top edge. The leaf's width spans across the entire white square.

To summarize:
- Aspect ratio: 1:2
- Colors: Red (Pantone 186C) and White (Pantone White)
- Red bands: 1/4 of the flag's length each
- White square: Width equal to the flag's height
- Maple leaf: Symmetrical, spanning the entire white square
