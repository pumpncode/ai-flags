The flag of Malawi has three horizontal stripes and a red rising sun with 31 rays on the top stripe. The color codes for the stripes are:

1. Black (top stripe): #000000
2. Red (middle stripe): #CE1126
3. Green (bottom stripe): #007A5E

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning its width is two units while its height is three units. The red rising sun is centered on the black stripe and has a diameter equal to one-third of the flag's height.

Geometrically, the flag can be divided into three equal horizontal rectangles, each occupying one-third of the flag's height. The sun is inscribed within a circle whose center lies on the midpoint of the top edge of the middle rectangle.
