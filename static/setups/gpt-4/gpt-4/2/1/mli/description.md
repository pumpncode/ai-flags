The flag of Mali consists of three vertical stripes of equal width. The colors and their respective hex color codes are:

1. Green (left stripe) - #14B53A
2. Yellow (middle stripe) - #FCD116
3. Red (right stripe) - #CE1126

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning its width is two-thirds of its length. There are no specific geometric properties or measurements beyond the equal width of the stripes.
