The flag of Turkey consists of a red background (#E30A17) with a white star and crescent. The aspect ratio is 2:3. The geometric properties are as follows:

1. Crescent:
   - Inner circle diameter: 2/5 of the flag's width
   - Outer circle diameter: 1/2 of the flag's width
   - Center of circles: 1/8 of the flag's width from the hoist side, and 1/2 of the flag's height from the top

2. Star:
   - Five-pointed star with each point equidistant from one another
   - Circumscribed circle diameter: 1/4 of the flag's width
   - Center of the circle: 5/8 of the flag's width from the hoist side, and 1/2 of the flag's height from the top

These measurements ensure that the star and crescent are proportionally sized and positioned on the flag.
