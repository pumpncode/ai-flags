The flag of Costa Rica consists of five horizontal stripes: blue (#002B7F) on top, followed by white (#FFFFFF), red (#CE1126), white (#FFFFFF), and blue (#002B7F) at the bottom. The red stripe is twice as wide as the other stripes. The aspect ratio of the flag is 3:5.

Geometrically, the flag can be divided into 14 equal horizontal bands, with the blue and white stripes each occupying two bands, and the red stripe occupying six bands. If the flag's width is denoted as W and its length as L, then:

- L = (3/5)W
- Each blue and white stripe has a height of (1/7)W
- The red stripe has a height of (3/7)W
