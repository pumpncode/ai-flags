The flag of Dominica has an aspect ratio of 1:2. It features a green background with three bands forming a cross in the center. The vertical band is yellow (#FCD116) on top, black (#000000) in the middle, and white (#FFFFFF) at the bottom. The horizontal band is the same colors but reversed: white on the left, black in the middle, and yellow on the right. In the center of the cross, there's a red (#CE1126) circle with a diameter equal to 1/3 of the flag's width.

Inside the red circle, there's a Sisserou parrot (Amazona imperialis) facing left, surrounded by ten lime-green stars (#009E60). The parrot and stars are placed on a grayish-purple (#4C516D) disk with a diameter equal to 1/2 of the red circle's diameter. The stars form a circle with a radius equal to 1/2 of the grayish-purple disk's radius. Each star has a diameter equal to 1/16 of the flag's width.
