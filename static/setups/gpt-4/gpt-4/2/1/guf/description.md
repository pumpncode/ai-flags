The flag of French Guiana is not officially recognized, as it is an overseas department and region of France. Therefore, it does not have specific color codes, aspect ratio, geometric properties, or measurements. Instead, French Guiana uses the flag of France, which consists of three vertical stripes of blue (#002395), white (#FFFFFF), and red (#ED2939) with an aspect ratio of 2:3.
