The flag of Mongolia consists of three vertical stripes with a 1:2 aspect ratio. The left and right stripes are equal in width, while the middle stripe is twice as wide as the others. The colors used are:

1. Red (#C4272F): Left and right stripes.
2. Blue (#003DA5): Middle stripe.

On the left red stripe, there's a golden Soyombo symbol (a national emblem) centered vertically. The Soyombo symbol has a height equal to 80% of the stripe's width. The blue stripe represents 2/3 of the flag's total width, while each red stripe represents 1/6 of the flag's total width.
