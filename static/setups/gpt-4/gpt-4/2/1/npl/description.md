The flag of Nepal is unique, as it's the only non-quadrilateral national flag. It consists of two overlapping right-angled triangles (pennons) with a crimson red (#DC143C) background and blue (#000080) border. The smaller triangle on top has a white stylized moon with eight rays and a crescent, while the larger triangle at the bottom features a white 12-pointed sun.

The flag doesn't have a fixed aspect ratio due to its irregular shape. However, the official construction sheet specifies the dimensions of various elements:

1. Width of the border: 1/16 of the flag's width
2. Distance between the triangles: 1/16 of the flag's width
3. Height of the upper triangle: 3/4 of the flag's width
4. Height of the lower triangle: 5/8 of the flag's width

These measurements ensure that the flag maintains its unique shape and proportions when resized or reproduced.
