The flag of Réunion does not have an official design, as it is an overseas department and region of France. Therefore, it does not have specific color codes, aspect ratio, geometric properties, or measurements. Instead, the French flag, known as the Tricolore, is used to represent Réunion. The French flag consists of three vertical stripes of equal width in blue (#002395), white (#FFFFFF), and red (#ED2939) with an aspect ratio of 2:3.
