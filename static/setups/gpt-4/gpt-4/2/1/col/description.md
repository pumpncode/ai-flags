The flag of Colombia consists of three horizontal stripes with the following colors and proportions:

1. Top stripe: Yellow (Pantone 116 C) - occupies 50% of the flag's width
2. Middle stripe: Blue (Pantone 287 C) - occupies 25% of the flag's width
3. Bottom stripe: Red (Pantone 186 C) - occupies 25% of the flag's width

The aspect ratio of the Colombian flag is 2:3, meaning its width is 1.5 times its height. The flag does not have any specific geometric properties or measurements beyond these proportions and color codes.
