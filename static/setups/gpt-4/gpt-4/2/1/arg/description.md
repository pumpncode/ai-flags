The flag of Argentina consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width. The top and bottom stripes are light blue (#75AADB), while the middle stripe is white (#FFFFFF). In the center of the white stripe, there is a golden-yellow Sun of May emblem (#F2A800).

The aspect ratio of the flag is 9:14, meaning its width is 1.56 times its height. The Sun of May has a diameter that is 5/6 the height of the white stripe. It features a face with 32 rays, alternating between straight and wavy.

Exact measurements depend on the size of the flag being produced, but the proportions remain consistent.
