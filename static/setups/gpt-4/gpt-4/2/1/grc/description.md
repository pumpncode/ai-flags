The flag of Greece consists of nine horizontal stripes alternating between blue (#0D5EAF) and white (#FFFFFF), with a blue canton in the upper hoist-side corner featuring a white cross. The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3.

The flag has five blue stripes and four white stripes, with the top and bottom stripes being blue. The canton is a square that spans the width of the first five stripes (two white and three blue). The white cross within the canton is centered and has arms of equal length, dividing the canton into four equal rectangles.

Exact measurements and geometric properties may vary depending on the specific flag's size and intended use.
