The flag of Andorra has a vertical tricolor design with three equal bands. The aspect ratio is 7:10. From left to right, the colors are:

1. Blue (#003893)
2. Yellow (#FFD700)
3. Red (#CE1126)

In the center of the yellow band, there is the coat of arms of Andorra, which contains various elements and colors. However, since you requested not to include symbolism, I will refrain from describing it further.

The flag's geometric properties and measurements are as follows:

- Each vertical band has a width equal to 1/3 of the flag's total width.
- The height of the flag is 7 units, while the width is 10 units.

That's a concise description of the Andorran flag without discussing its symbolism.
