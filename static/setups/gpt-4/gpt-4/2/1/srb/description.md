The flag of Serbia has a horizontal tricolor design with three equal stripes. The colors and their respective HEX color codes are:

1. Top stripe: Red (#C6363D)
2. Middle stripe: Blue (#0C4076)
3. Bottom stripe: White (#FFFFFF)

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning its width is two units while its height is three units. In the center of the blue stripe, there is a coat of arms. The coat of arms is not centered on the flag but rather positioned closer to the hoist side, specifically at the distance of one-seventh of the flag's length from the hoist.

The coat of arms consists of a double-headed eagle and a shield. The shield is divided into four quarters, each containing a different symbol. Above the shield, there is a crown. The coat of arms' colors include gold, silver, red, and blue.
