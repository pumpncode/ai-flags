The flag of Benin has a ratio of 2:3 and consists of two equally sized horizontal stripes - the top one is yellow (#FECB00) while the bottom one is red (#CE1126). In the center of the flag, there is a green (#008751) vertical band that touches both stripes, edged with thin white lines at either side. The green band contains a white five-pointed star known as the 'Star of Benin,' which has a diameter of approximately one-third of the width of the flag. The distance between the left edge of the green band and the hoist is 1/20th of the flag's width.
