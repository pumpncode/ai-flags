The flag of Ecuador has a ratio of 2:3 and is composed of three horizontal bands of equal size. The top and bottom bands are yellow (#FCD116) while the middle band is blue (#00247D). Centered in the middle of the flag is the national coat of arms that is 1/2 the height of the flag. The coat of arms consists of an Andean condor perched on top of a mountain, holding a ribbon in its beak that bears the Ecuadorian national motto. The mountain rises from the sea, which is depicted with a red border. The sun shines behind the mountain and is accompanied by the Gemini Constellation.

The geometric properties of the flag are as follows: The height of the flag is divided into three equal parts that give the width of each band. The coat of arms has a circle with a diameter of 3/8ths the height of the flag. The condor on top of the mountain is 1/4th the height of the flag.

There are variations of the flag used for certain purposes or events, such as the naval ensign, which includes anchors crossed beneath the coat of arms.
