The left half is red (#D20000), while the right half features a stylized yellow sun with eight broadening rays extending to the edges of the flag (#FFCE00). The sun contains a central yellow disk with a red dot in the middle, representing the Sun of Vergina, an ancient symbol associated with the Macedonian dynasty of Alexander the Great's father, Philip II of Macedon.

The dimensions of the flag are not specified in its law, but it is typically flown in sizes ranging from 60 x 90 cm to 200 x 300 cm.
