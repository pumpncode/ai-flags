There is no official flag of Antarctica as it is not a sovereign state. However, there are various flags used to represent the continent in different contexts, such as the Antarctic Treaty and scientific expeditions.

One commonly used flag features a white silhouette of Antarctica on a blue background. The aspect ratio varies depending on the size of the flag, but a common measurement for a large flag is 2:3. The hex color code for the blue background is #003F87.

Other flags used in Antarctica include the national flags of countries with territorial claims, such as Chile and Argentina, and the UN flag, which is used on some scientific bases.
