The flag of Namibia has a rectangular shape with an aspect ratio of 2:3. It is divided diagonally from the lower hoist-side corner to the upper fly-side corner by a white stripe, with a blue triangle at the hoist and a green triangle at the fly. The blue triangle represents the sky and the Atlantic Ocean, while the green triangle symbolizes the land and vegetation of Namibia. The top-left corner of the triangle contains a sun with 12 rays in red, which represents life and energy. The colors used in the flag are defined as follows: 

- Blue: Pantone 280 C / RGB (0, 63, 135) / CMYK (100, 65, 0, 47)
