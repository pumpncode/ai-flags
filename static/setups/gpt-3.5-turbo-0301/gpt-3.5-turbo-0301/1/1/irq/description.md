The flag of Iraq consists of three equal horizontal stripes, with red on top, white in the middle, and black on the bottom. The Arabic words "Allahu Akbar" (God is Great) are inscribed in green Kufic script centered in the white stripe. The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, with a height-to-width ratio of 1.5. The exact color codes of the flag are not specified, but it is generally described as having a slightly dark shade of red and black, and a pure white. The flag has no geometric properties or measurements beyond its aspect ratio.
