The flag of Kazakhstan consists of a light blue background with a golden sun and eagle in the center. The sun has 32 rays, while the eagle has its wings spread wide and faces the hoist side. The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning that it is twice as long as it is wide. The geometric properties are rectangular, with width measuring half the length. The precise color codes for the flag are not standardized but listed below are common approximations:

- Light blue: Pantone 306C or RGB(0, 154, 206)
- Gold: Pantone 116C or RGB(255, 203, 5)

The sun and eagle occupy the center third of the flag's height and extend to two-thirds of its width.
