The flag of Sweden is a rectangular-shaped banner with a ratio of 5:2 (length to width). It consists of a blue background with a yellow/gold Scandinavian cross stretching from edge to edge, offset towards the hoist side. The vertical arm of the cross is shifted slightly closer to the hoist than the horizontal arm. The color codes for the flag are Pantone 301C for the blue and Pantone 116C for the yellow/gold. The geometric properties of the flag are that the vertical dimension is twice as long as the horizontal dimension, and the cross divides the flag into four equal rectangles. The dimensions of the flag depend on its intended use but can range from 20 x 10 cm to 150 x 300 cm or more.
