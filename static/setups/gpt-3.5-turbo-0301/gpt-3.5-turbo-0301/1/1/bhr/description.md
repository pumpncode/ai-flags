The flag of Bahrain has a proportion of 3:5 (height to width) and consists of two main sections: a white stripe on the left side and a red stripe on the right side, each taking up half of the flag's width. The two stripes are separated by a serrated line of five triangles that alternates between white and red. 

The exact color codes for the flag are:

- Red: Pantone 186 C; RGB: 206, 17, 38; Hexadecimal: CE1126
- White: Pantone White; RGB: 255, 255, 255; Hexadecimal: FFFFFF

The geometric properties and measurements of the flag are as follows:

- The height of the flag is three-fifths (0.6) of the width.
- The width of the flag is 30 units.
- The height of the flag is 18 units.
- The top point of the serrated line is situated at 7 units from the hoist side of the flag.
- The bottom point of the serrated line is situated at 23 units from the hoist side of the flag.

It's worth noting that the design of the Bahraini flag was adopted on February 14, 2002, and it replaced an older version of the flag which had been used since the country gained independence from Britain in 1971.
