The flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of a blue background with a yellow isosceles triangle pointing towards the hoist side, and seven white five-pointed stars arranged in an arc above the base of the triangle. The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2. The height of the triangle is equal to half the length of the flag, and the stars are arranged at a radius of 1/6 of the length of the flag, centered on the triangle. The color codes for the flag are:

- Blue: Pantone 286 C / RGB 0, 70, 135
- Yellow: Pantone 116 C / RGB 255, 204, 0
- White: RGB 255, 255, 255

The geometric properties and measurements of the flag are:

- Length: twice the height of the triangle (i.e., 2h)
- Height of the triangle: 1/2 of the length of the flag (i.e., h)
- Base of the triangle: 1/3 of the length of the flag (i.e., 2h/3)
- Radius of the stars: 1/6 of the length of the flag (i.e., h/3)

Note that the official description of the flag also includes the position of the stars, which are arranged in two rows of three and one row of one, with the single star at the top. However, this information is not necessary to describe the physical appearance of the flag.
