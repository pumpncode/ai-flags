The flag of Mongolia consists of three vertical stripes; the center stripe is red and twice the width of the other two, which are blue. In the upper left corner, there is a yellow soyombo symbol, which is made up of 10 traditional Mongolian symbols.

The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, with a total dimension of 150 cm x 75 cm (59 in x 29.5 in).

The color codes for the flag are as follows: Pantone 7628 C for red, Pantone 285 C for blue, and Pantone Yellow C for yellow.

The geometric properties of the flag are straightforward, with equal-sized rectangles placed together to form the overall rectangular shape. The exact measurements of those shapes are not specified, but it is known that the red stripe is twice the width of the blue ones.

It's worth noting that the soyombo symbol on the flag has its own set of geometric properties and measurements, but those details fall outside the scope of this response.
