The flag of Togo features five alternating horizontal stripes of green and yellow, with a red square located in the upper left corner. The width-to-length ratio is 2:3. 

The geometric properties and measurements are as follows: 
- The height of the red square is equal to the height of two stripes (i.e., two-fifths the height of the flag).
- The side of the red square is equal to the width of one stripe (i.e., one-fifth the width of the flag).
- The remaining three-fifths of the flag are divided equally into two green and two yellow stripes.
- The colors have specific Pantone codes: Green PMS 355, Yellow PMS 116, and Red PMS 485.

Note that the flag's design was modified slightly in 1992, changing the shade of green and improving the quality of the flag's materials.
