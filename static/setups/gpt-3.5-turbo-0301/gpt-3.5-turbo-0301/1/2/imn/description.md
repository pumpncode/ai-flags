The flag of the Isle of Man consists of a red field with a centered triskelion, which is a three-legged emblem composed of three armored legs conjoined at the thigh. The triskelion is gold in color and features a bent arm holding an axe in the uppermost part of each leg. 

The aspect ratio of the flag is 3:5. The geometric properties and measurements are as follows: the diameter of the triskelion is one-third the width of the flag, and the length of the curved lines connecting the legs is one-fifth the width of the flag.

The official color codes for the flag are:

- Red: Pantone 186C / RGB 206,17,38 / CMYK 0,100,83,4
- Gold: Pantone 116C / RGB 255,204,0 / CMYK 0,14,100,0

The flag was officially adopted on July 9, 1932, although the triskelion emblem has been associated with the island for centuries.
