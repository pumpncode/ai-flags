The flag of the Northern Mariana Islands is rectangular with a ratio of 2:3. It consists of a blue field with a white, five-pointed star and a decorative wreath in red located off-center towards the hoist. The star has a diameter of 3/8 of the flag width, while the wreath's diameter is 4/5 of the star's diameter. The colors of the flag are specified as follows: 
- Blue: Pantone 286 C / RGB #0072c6 / CMYK (100, 63, 0, 0) 
- White: N/A / RGB #FFFFFF / CMYK (0, 0, 0, 0) 
- Red: Pantone 186 C / RGB #d7141a / CMYK (0, 100, 81, 4)

The geometric design of the flag is simple, with only three elements - the blue field, the white star, and the red wreath. The placement of the star and the wreath create an asymmetrical composition that gives the flag a distinct character.
