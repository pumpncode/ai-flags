The flag of Russia consists of three horizontal stripes: white on the top, blue in the middle, and red on the bottom. The ratio of the flag's width to its length is 2:3. The colors used are defined by the following Pantone codes: 
- White: Pantone 704 
- Blue: Pantone 286 
- Red: Pantone 485 

The geometric properties and measurements of the flag are as follows:
- The height of each stripe is equal to one-third the height of the flag.
- The width of the white stripe is equal to the width of the other two stripes combined.
- The distance between the left edge of the flag and the left edge of each colored stripe is equal to the width of one of the stripes.

The flag is also sometimes referred to as the "tricolor" or the "tri-colour."
