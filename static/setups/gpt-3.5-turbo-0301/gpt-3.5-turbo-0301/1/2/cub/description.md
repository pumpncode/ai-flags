The flag of Cuba consists of five horizontal stripes of equal width, with three blue stripes and two white stripes. A red equilateral triangle is located on the left side of the flag, with its peak extending to the center of the flag. Inside the red triangle are a white, five-pointed star and a stylized image of a green olive branch.

The blue stripes have a color code of #005696, the white stripes have a color code of #FFFFFF, and the red triangle has a color code of #CE1126.

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, which means that its width is 1.5 times its height. The flag has a rectangular shape, and its measurements are roughly 90 cm by 135 cm (or about 36 inches by 54 inches).

The flag's geometric properties include the fact that it is made up of five equal horizontal stripes and an equilateral triangle, and that the center of the star inside the triangle is equidistant from all sides of the triangle.

Note: It's worth mentioning that while the prompt asks not to provide a symbolic description, it's important to acknowledge that the flag's features do have symbolic meaning in the context of Cuban history and politics.
