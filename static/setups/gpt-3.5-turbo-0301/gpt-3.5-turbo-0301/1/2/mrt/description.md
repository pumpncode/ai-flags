The flag of Mauritania consists of a green field with a gold crescent and star in the center. The aspect ratio is 2:3, and the geometric properties are straightforward as it is a rectangular flag. The color codes for the flag are as follows:

- Green: Pantone 356 C / RGB: 12, 127, 13 / HEX: #0C7F0D
- Gold: Pantone 116 C / RGB: 255, 204, 0 / HEX: #FFCC00

There are no official measurements for the flag's height or width, but the proportions should remain consistent with the 2:3 aspect ratio.
