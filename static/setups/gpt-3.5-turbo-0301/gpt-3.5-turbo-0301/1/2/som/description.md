The flag of Somalia consists of a light blue field with a large white five-pointed star in the center. The blue color is officially defined as Pantone 299c or RGB value of 0,156,227. The white color of the star matches the background and does not have a specific code. 

The aspect ratio of the Somali flag is 2:1, meaning that for every two units of width, there is one unit of height. The geometric properties are straightforward: the flag is rectangular with no other design elements or borders.

In terms of measurements, the flag's width should be twice its height. For example, a standard-sized Somali flag would be 6 feet wide by 3 feet tall (1.83 meters by 0.91 meters). However, there is no official specification regarding the exact size of the flag.

It's worth noting that the design of the Somali flag has remained unchanged since it was first adopted on October 12, 1954, except for a minor modification of the star's placement in 2012.
