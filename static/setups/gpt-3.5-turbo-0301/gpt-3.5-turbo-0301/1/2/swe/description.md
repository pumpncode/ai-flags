The flag of Sweden consists of a rectangular field divided horizontally into two equal parts: the top part is blue (Pantone 301C), and the bottom part is yellow (Pantone 116C). The aspect ratio of the flag is 5:2, with each horizontal section having a width-to-length ratio of 10:19. The geometric properties and measurements are as follows: the blue field has a height of 4/9 of the total flag height, while the yellow field has a height of 5/9 of the total flag height. The cross in the center of the flag is offset towards the left side of the flag by 1/18 of the flag's length. The cross itself has arms of equal length, with a width of 5/18 of the flag's length.
