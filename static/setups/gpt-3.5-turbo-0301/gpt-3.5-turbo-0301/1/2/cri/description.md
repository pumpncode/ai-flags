The flag of Costa Rica consists of five horizontal stripes: blue, white, red, white, and blue. The blue stripes are twice the width of the other four stripes. The aspect ratio of the flag is 5:3. The exact color codes for the flag are:

- Blue: Pantone 300C / #0072c6
- White: #FFFFFF
- Red: Pantone 186C / #DA291C

The geometric properties and measurements of the flag are as follows:

- The overall width of the flag should be three-fifths (3/5) of its length.
- The blue stripes should be at the top and bottom of the flag, and each should be one-fifth (1/5) of the total height of the flag.
- The white stripes should be next to the blue stripes, and each should be one-tenth (1/10) of the total height of the flag.
- The red stripe should be in the center of the flag, and it should be two-fifths (2/5) of the total height of the flag.

The flag of Costa Rica was officially adopted on November 27, 1906, but its design has remained unchanged since then.
