The flag of Japan, also known as the "Nissh≈çki" or "Hinomaru," consists of a rectangular white field with a circular red disc in its center. The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, and the diameter of the red disc is three-fifths of the flag's height. The color codes for the flag are:

- White: #FFFFFF
- Red: #DC143C

The flag has no official symbolism or meaning, but it has been associated with the Japanese national identity since the late 19th century. The proportions and geometric properties of the flag have been standardized by law, with the disc's position and size specified in relation to the edges of the flag.
