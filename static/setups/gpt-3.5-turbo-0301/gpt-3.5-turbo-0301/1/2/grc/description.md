The flag of Greece consists of nine horizontal stripes of blue and white colors, with a blue square located at the top left corner. The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning that its length is one and a half times its width. The geometric properties of the flag are rectangular, with the blue square occupying one-fourth of the overall height of the flag. The color codes for the blue stripes are Pantone 280 C or RGB (0, 34, 255), while the white stripes have no specific code as they are simply the color of the fabric on which the blue stripes are printed. The blue square also has a specific color code of Pantone 286 C or RGB (0, 85, 164). The exact measurements of the flag vary depending on its size, but its dimensions are typically between 1.5 and 3 meters in length and 1 to 2 meters in width.
