The flag of New Zealand features a dark blue field with the Union Jack in the canton (upper left corner) and four five-pointed red stars outlined in white, forming the Southern Cross constellation. The stars have different sizes, with the smallest star at the top and the largest at the bottom right. The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2. The color codes for the flag are:

- Blue: Pantone 280 C / RGB 0, 33, 71 / CMYK 100, 65, 0, 56
- Red: Pantone 186 C / RGB 255, 0, 0 / CMYK 0, 100, 100, 0

The Union Jack measures approximately three-fifths of the width of the flag, while the diameter of each star is about one-sixth of the width of the flag. The distance between the edge of the flag and the outer points of the stars is equal to the radius of the smallest star. The flag has no official geometric properties or measurements, but its commonly used dimensions are 1200 x 2400 mm for the outdoor flag and 900 x 1800 mm for the indoor flag.
