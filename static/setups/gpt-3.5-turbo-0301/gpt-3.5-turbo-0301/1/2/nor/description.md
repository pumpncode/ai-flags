The flag of Norway consists of a red field with an off-centered white cross that extends to the edges of the flag. The vertical arm of the cross is shifted to the hoist side, or left-hand side, of the flag. The aspect ratio of the flag is 8:11, with the width being 8/17 of the length. 

The geometric properties of the flag can be described as follows: the white cross has a width equal to 1/5 of the flag's length and a distance from the hoist side equal to 2/9 of the flag's length. The horizontal arm of the cross also has a width equal to 1/5 of the flag's length, and its midpoint is located at 1/2 of the distance between the top and bottom of the flag.

The official color codes for the flag are:

- Red: Pantone 186 C / CMYK (0, 100, 81, 4) / RGB (239, 41, 41) / HEX #EF2929
- White: CMYK (0, 0, 0, 0) / RGB (255, 255, 255) / HEX #FFFFFF

The flag's dimensions are not fixed, but according to official recommendations, the width should be 6.5 times the size of the cross's vertical arm, and the distance from the hoist side to the center of the cross should be 4 times the size of the cross's vertical arm.

Note that some variations of the flag exist, such as the naval flag, which includes a swallowtail design and a larger cross.
