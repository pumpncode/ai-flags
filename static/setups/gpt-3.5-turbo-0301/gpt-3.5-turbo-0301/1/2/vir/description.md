The flag of the United States Virgin Islands consists of a white field with a simplified version of the USVI seal in the center, which depicts an eagle holding a sprig of laurel and three arrows in its talons. The eagle is surrounded by a yellow circular band that contains the text "Government of the United States Virgin Islands" at the top and "In God We Trust" at the bottom. The blue background on the shield represents the Caribbean Sea and the green stripes represent the islands' hills. 

The dimensions of the flag have an aspect ratio of 2:3, meaning that for every 2 units of width, there are 3 units of height. The diameter of the circular band around the eagle is 2/9 the height of the flag. The colors used in the flag are Pantone 280 C for the blue, Pantone 349 C for the green, and Pantone 116 C for the yellow.
