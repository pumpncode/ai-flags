The flag of Cook Islands consists of a dark blue background with a white circle in the center. Inside the circle are fifteen stars, forming a ring around a depiction of a traditional vaka moana (outrigger canoe) in yellow and black. The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, and its geometric properties include a rectangle with a height of twice its width. The yellow of the vaka moana is Pantone 116 C, and the black is Pantone Black C. The color code for the blue is not specified, but it is described as "dark blue." The diameter of the white circle is two-thirds the width of the flag.
