The flag of Mexico consists of three vertical stripes in green, white, and red, with the national coat of arms centered in the white stripe. The aspect ratio of the flag is 4:7. The green stripe measures one-third the width of the flag and is located at the hoist side, while the red stripe occupies the other two-thirds of the flag's width and is located at the fly side. The white stripe is twice the height of each of the other two stripes.

The colors of the flag are defined as follows:

The coat of arms in the center of the white stripe is a golden eagle standing on a cactus with a serpent in its beak, surrounded by a garland of oak and laurel leaves. The diameter of the coat of arms is three-fourths the height of the white stripe.
