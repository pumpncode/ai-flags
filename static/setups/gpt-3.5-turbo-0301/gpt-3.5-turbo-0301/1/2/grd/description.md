The flag of Grenada consists of a red field with a centered yellow circle containing six green stars placed in the shape of an inverted equilateral triangle. The aspect ratio is 3:5. The diameter of the yellow circle is 3/5 of the height of the flag, and the stars have a radius of 1/15 of the height of the flag. The color codes are:

- Red: Pantone 186 C / RGB 220, 20, 60 / #DC143C
- Yellow: Pantone 116 C / RGB 255, 204, 0 / #FFCC00
- Green: Pantone 356 C / RGB 0, 128, 0 / #008000

The geometric properties of the flag are that the yellow circle is positioned at the exact center of the flag's width and at 3/10 of the flag's height from the top edge. The six stars are arranged symmetrically around the circle, with their points touching the circumference of the circle and forming an inverted equilateral triangle.

Overall, the flag has a simple design with bold colors and strong symmetry.
