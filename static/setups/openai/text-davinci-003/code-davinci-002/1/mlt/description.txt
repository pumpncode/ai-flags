The national flag of Malta is a vertical triband of equal, white and red with a representation of the George Cross, edged with a white trim, being superimposed at the centre in such a way that the vertical arms of the cross extend to the edges of the flag and the horizontal ones halfway across its width. The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3.
