The flag of Costa Rica is made up of two horizontal bands of blue (representing the sky and the ocean) and white (representing the clouds and peace). The blue bands span the flag from edge to edge, while the white has a width of approximately one-fifth (1/5) of the entire length. The hoist side holds a red triangle containing a white five-pointed star. This triangle has a width of approximately one-eighth (1/8) of the flag length. The ratio of the flag is 5:3.
