The flag of the Marshall Islands consists of a blue field with two horizontal stripes of yellow and white, separated by a white 24:12:24:12:24 initials; the width of the stripes being half the height of the flag. The yellow strip has a white 24-pointed star in its center. The top (hoist) side of the star points towards the left side and has eight short strokes indicating its rays. The bottom edge is ultimately rounded.
