The flag of Palestine is a simplified horizontal tricolor with a green stripe on top, divided by a white stripe in the center, and a black stripe on the bottom. The width of the vertical central white stripe is equal to the width of two of the color stripes combined, meaning the aspect ratio is 1:2.
