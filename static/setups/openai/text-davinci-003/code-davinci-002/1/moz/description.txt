The flag of Mozambique features a horizontal triband of green, white and yellow. The width of the flag is in a ratio of 2:3, with the green stripe above a white stripe, each of which takes up a quarter of the flag. Below the white stripe is a yellow stripe, again taking up a quarter of the flag. The center of the flag features an emblem comprising a gear encircled with a book, a hoe and an AK-47 crossed beneath a red star.
