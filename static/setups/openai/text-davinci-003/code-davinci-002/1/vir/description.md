The flag of the United States Virgin Islands is a white American wavy stripe, which is two-thirds of the height of the flag, bisected by a broken broad blue stripe, with a Â½ of the width. In the top corner is a simplified version of the coat of arms of Denmark, a yellow isosceles triangle with a small upright cross at the apex, surrounded by dark blue islands on a bright blue sea.
