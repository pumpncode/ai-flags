The flag of Dominica is rectangular in shape with a ratio of length to width that is 2:3. It is dark green with a central disc bearing a yellow, five-pointed star symbolizing the hope of the people and surrounded by 10 green, five-pointed stars standing for the 10 parishes of the island. There are also two narrow yellow wavy lines on the green background, representing the rivers of the island.
