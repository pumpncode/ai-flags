This was a tough one, and it's the reason the threevex tool exists. I get that the AI probably meant the ratio of the three stripes to each other, but it already stated that relation in the sentence before and also virtually every other description generated by this setup always mentioned the ratio of the whole flag as the last sentence, so...this is what you get, stupid robot.
