The flag of Nigeria consists of three vertical stripes of equal size. The two outer stripes are green, while the middle stripe is white. The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2. The hex color codes for the green stripes are #008751 and #FFFFFF for the white stripe. The geometric properties and measurements of the flag are as follows: the width of each stripe is one-third of the total width of the flag, the length of the flag is twice its width (i.e., 2:3 ratio), and the diameter of the central white circle on the green stripes is equal to half the width of the flag.
