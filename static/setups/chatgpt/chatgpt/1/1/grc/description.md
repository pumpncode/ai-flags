The flag of Greece is a rectangular bicolor flag consisting of nine equal horizontal stripes of blue alternating with white, with a blue canton in the upper hoist-side corner bearing a white cross. The ratio of the width to the length of the flag is 2:3. The exact shades of blue used are defined by law as Pantone Blue 280 C (RGB: 0, 56, 147) for the top and bottom stripes and Pantone Blue 1837 C (RGB: 0, 85, 164) for the middle stripe and the canton. The cross has a width of 1/5 of the flag's height and is positioned at a distance of 1/9 of the flag's width from the left edge and 1/9 of the flag's height from the top edge.
