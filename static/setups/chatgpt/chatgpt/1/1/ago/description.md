The flag of Angola consists of two horizontal stripes of equal size, with a larger red stripe at the top and a smaller black stripe at the bottom. In the center of the flag, there's a golden emblem that features a machete, a gear, and a star, with half a cogwheel on either side of the emblem. 

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning that the flag's height is 1.5 times its width. The color codes for the flag are:

- Red: Pantone 485 C / RGB 219, 29, 41 / #DB1D29
- Black: Pantone Process Black C / RGB 0, 0, 0 / #000000
- Gold: Pantone 116 C / RGB 255, 204, 0 / #FFCC00

The emblem in the center of the flag is yellow-gold with black outlines, and measures approximately 2/5 of the flag's height and 2/7 of its width. The gear inside the emblem has 11 cogs and measures approximately 4/9 of the emblem's height. The half-cogwheels on either side have five cogs each and measure approximately 3/16 of the emblem's height.

Overall, the flag's dimensions can vary depending on its intended use, but typically it measures around 135cm x 90cm (or 54 inches x 36 inches) when used as a national flag.
