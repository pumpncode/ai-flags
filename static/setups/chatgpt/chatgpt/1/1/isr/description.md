The flag of Israel consists of a white background with two horizontal blue stripes, one at the top and one at the bottom of the flag. In the center of the white field is a blue Star of David. The aspect ratio of the flag is 8:11. The blue stripes each measure one-sixth the width of the flag (approximately 67 pixels in a standard 1000x1100 pixel resolution), while the Star of David measures approximately one-third the width of the flag (approximately 222 pixels in a standard 1000x1100 pixel resolution). The blue color used for the stripes and Star of David is defined by Pantone 280 C (#003399), while the white color of the background is left uncoated.
