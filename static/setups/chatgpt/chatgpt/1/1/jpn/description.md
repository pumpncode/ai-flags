The flag of Japan, also known as the "Nissh≈çki" or "Hinomaru," is a rectangular panel with a 2:3 aspect ratio. The flag consists of a white background with a large red circle in the center, with the exact shade of red specified as CIELAB coordinates of L*93 a*55 b*40 and hex code #FF0000. The circle's diameter measures three-fifths the width of the flag, meaning that it has an approximate measurement of one-third of the length of the flag on both horizontal sides. The flag does not have any specific geometric properties beyond its rectangular shape, and it is commonly used as a national symbol of Japan.
