The flag of Germany, also known as the Bundesflagge or "federal flag", consists of three horizontal stripes of equal dimensions. The top stripe is black (RGB 0, 0, 0), the middle stripe is red (RGB 255, 0, 0), and the bottom stripe is gold or yellow (RGB 255, 206, 0). 

The aspect ratio of the flag is 3:5, meaning that its width is 1.5 times its height. The flag's geometric properties are rectangular, with a height of 1 unit and a width of 1.5 units. 

The black stripe is located at the top of the flag (nearest to the flagpole), followed by the red stripe in the middle and the gold/yellow stripe at the bottom. The colors of the flag have been used in various forms since the early 19th century and were officially adopted as the national flag of Germany in 1919.
