The flag of the Netherlands, also known as the Dutch flag, consists of three horizontal stripes of equal size, colored orange (top), white (middle), and blue (bottom). The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning that its height is 1.5 times its width. The geometric properties of the flag are straightforward: it is a rectangle with straight sides and right angles. The colors used in the flag have specific Pantone values: PMS 165 for orange, PMS White for white, and PMS 280 for blue. The measurements of the flag vary depending on its intended use, but the standard dimensions are 157 cm x 100 cm for official use and 225 cm x 150 cm for ceremonial occasions.
