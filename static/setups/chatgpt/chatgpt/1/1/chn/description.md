The flag of China consists of a red field with five golden-yellow stars in the upper-left corner. The ratio of the width to the length of the flag is 2:3. The larger star represents the Communist Party of China, while the four smaller stars represent the social classes of the people. The color code for the red background is RGB 255,0,0 or #FF0000, and the color code for the yellow stars is RGB 255,223,0 or #FFDF00. The stars are arranged in a five-pointed pattern, each with a diameter of one-fifth of the height of the red field. The distance between the center of the larger star and a small star is equal to twice the radius of the small star.
