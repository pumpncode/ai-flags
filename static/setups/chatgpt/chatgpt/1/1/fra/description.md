The flag has an aspect ratio of 2:3, meaning that its width is twice its height. Its geometric properties are that it is a rectangular shape with a length of three units and width of two units. The exact measurements of the flag vary depending on its intended use, but the standard size for a French national flag is 90 cm x 135 cm.
