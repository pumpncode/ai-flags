The flag of Denmark is a rectangular banner with an aspect ratio of 3:2 (width to height). It consists of a red field with a white Scandinavian cross, which extends to the edges of the flag. The vertical part of the cross is shifted towards the hoist side of the flag, so that it appears closer to the left edge than to the right.

The color code for the red used in the flag is Pantone 186C, and for the white, it's Pantone White. The geometric properties of the cross include a width equal to 1/5th of the flag's height, and the horizontal arms of the cross are centred at 1/2 of the flag's height.

The Danish flag has no official meaning or symbolism, but it is one of the oldest national flags in continuous use, dating back to the 14th century. It is also known as the Dannebrog, which means "Danish cloth" in Danish.
