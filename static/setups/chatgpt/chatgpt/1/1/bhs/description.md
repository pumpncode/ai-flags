The flag of the Bahamas has a design that consists of three horizontal stripes of equal size. The top and bottom stripes are aquamarine in color, while the middle stripe is gold. Centered within the gold stripe is a black equilateral triangle, with its top vertex at the center of the hoist side (the side closest to the flagpole). Inside the triangle is a stylized image of a yellow bird, the national bird of the Bahamas, in flight.
