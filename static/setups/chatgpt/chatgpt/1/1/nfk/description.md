The flag of Norfolk Island consists of three vertical bands of green, white, and yellow. The green band is located at the hoist side, occupying 1/3 of the flag's width, while the white and yellow bands occupy the remaining 2/3 of the flag's width, with the white band in the center. The ratio of the flag's height to its width is 1:2, and the color codes are as follows: 
- Green: Pantone 348C; RGB 0, 114, 54; #007236
- White: Pantone White; RGB 255, 255, 255; #FFFFFF
- Yellow: Pantone 116C; RGB 255, 204, 0; #FFCC00

The flag has a large green Norfolk Island Pine tree centered on the white band, with a green outline around it. The tree occupies 4/9 of the width of the white band and is vertically centered.

The aspect ratio and colors of the flag were officially adopted by the Norfolk Island Flag and Public Seal Act 1979.
