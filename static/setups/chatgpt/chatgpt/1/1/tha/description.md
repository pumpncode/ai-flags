- Red: Pantone 186 C / RGB #ED1C24

The geometric properties and measurements of the flag are as follows:
- The total width of the flag is 2 units, and the total length is 3 units.
- Each stripe has a width of 1/5th of the total width, which is 0.4 units.
- The distance between the two outermost stripes and the edge of the flag is 1/6th of the total width, which is 0.333... units.
- The circle in the middle of the flag has a diameter of 0.6 units, and its center is located at the intersection of the flag's vertical and horizontal axes.

Note that the circle in the middle of the flag may appear slightly off-center due to optical illusions created by its placement and size relative to the surrounding stripes.
