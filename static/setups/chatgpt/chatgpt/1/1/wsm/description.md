The flag of Samoa consists of a red field with a blue rectangle in the upper hoist-side corner bearing five white, five-pointed stars arranged in an X pattern. The dimensions of the flag are in the ratio of 1:2 (length to width).

The blue rectangle is equal to the width of the flag and extends two-thirds of the way down the length of the flag. The five stars represent the Southern Cross constellation, which is depicted on many flags of countries in the southern hemisphere.

The precise shades of red and blue used on the flag are not specified, but they are generally described as a bright, vibrant red and a medium or dark shade of blue. The colors can be approximated using various color models such as RGB or CMYK.

The geometric properties of the flag are rectangular, with a height equal to half its length. The flag has no official measurements, but it is typically flown in sizes ranging from around 2 feet by 3 feet to 8 feet by 12 feet.
