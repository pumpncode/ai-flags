The flag of India is rectangular in shape with a ratio of 2:3, which means the length is 1.5 times the width. It is made up of three horizontal stripes of equal width.

The top and bottom stripes are saffron in color, while the middle stripe is white. In the center of the white stripe, there is a navy blue wheel called the Ashoka Chakra with 24 spokes.

The colors used in the flag of India have specific codes assigned to them by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). Saffron is represented by code #FF9933, white by code #FFFFFF, and navy blue by code #000080.

The geometric properties and measurements of the Ashoka Chakra on the flag are also specified by the BIS. The diameter of the Chakra is approximately 0.6 times the height of the white stripe, and each spoke is evenly spaced and extends from the center of the circle to the outer rim.
