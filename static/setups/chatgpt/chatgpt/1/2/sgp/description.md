The flag of Singapore has a rectangular shape with the ratio of 2:3. It consists of two equal horizontal halves; the top half is white, while the bottom half is red. The colors are defined in the following color codes: 

- White: #FFFFFF 
- Red: #FF0000 

The flag's width and length are proportional to each other, with the length being 1.5 times longer than the width. The crescent moon and five stars in the top-left corner of the flag are each inscribed within a circle. The diameter of the circle that encompasses the crescent moon and stars is three-quarters the height of the white stripe. 

The moon is colored white with a radius equivalent to one-sixth the height of the white stripe. The five-pointed stars are vertically aligned to the right of the crescent moon, and each star has a diameter of one-fifth the height of the white stripe.

Note: While I have provided information about the geometric properties and measurements of the flag, it can be challenging to describe the flag's features without any symbolic description.
