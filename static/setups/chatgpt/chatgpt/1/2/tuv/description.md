The flag of Tuvalu consists of a light blue base with nine yellow stars arranged in a pattern representing the island nation's geography. The stars are five-pointed and situated in such a way that they form a diamond shape. The flag has an aspect ratio of 1:2, meaning it is twice as long as it is wide. The exact color codes used for the blue and yellow shades are not specified in official sources, but they are generally described as sky blue and gold respectively. The dimensions of the flag are standardized at 243 cm x 121.5 cm (approx. 8 ft x 4 ft).
