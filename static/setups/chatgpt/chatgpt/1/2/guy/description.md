The flag of Guyana consists of a green field with a yellow triangle on the left side and a larger black triangle on the right side. The two triangles are separated by a white diagonal line. The exact measurements vary, but the flag typically has an aspect ratio of 3:5. The geometric properties of the flag are fairly simple, with the triangles forming an isosceles right-angle triangle and the white line representing their hypotenuse. The colors used in the flag have specific Pantone codes: green (PMS 355), yellow (PMS 123) and black (PMS Black).
