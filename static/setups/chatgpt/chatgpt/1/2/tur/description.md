The flag of Turkey is a rectangular shape with an aspect ratio of 2:3. It consists of a red background with a white crescent moon and a five-pointed star centered slightly to the left side of the flag. The moon's inner edge is 5/9 of the way from the hoist side, while the diameter of the outer circle formed by the crescent is 3/4 of the flag's height. The star has a radius of 1/10 of the flag's height and is centered on the crescent. The color used for the red field is generally specified as "Cherry" or Pantone 186C, while the white elements are created by leaving those areas of the cloth untouched by dye.
