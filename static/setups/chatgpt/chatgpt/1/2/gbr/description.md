The flag of the United Kingdom, also known as the Union Jack, has an aspect ratio of 1:2. It consists of a blue field with a red diagonal cross (St. Patrick's Cross) that intersects with a white diagonal cross (St. Andrew's Cross). The white lines are equal in width to each other and twice as wide as the red lines. The flag's colours are defined as Pantone 280 C for blue, Pantone 186 C for red, and Pantone White. The geometric properties are such that the diagonals of the crosses intersect at the flag's center point. The measurement of the flag varies depending on its intended use, but typically it is 3 feet by 6 feet for use on land and 5 feet by 10 feet for use at sea.
