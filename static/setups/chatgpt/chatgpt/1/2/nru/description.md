The flag of Nauru has a blue background with a thin yellow stripe running horizontally across the center. A white twelve-pointed star is centered within the yellow stripe. The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning that its width is twice its height.

The geometric properties of the flag are as follows: the blue field covers two-thirds of the height of the flag, while the yellow stripe and white star occupy the remaining third. The diameter of the star is one-third the height of the flag, and its points touch the inner edges of the yellow stripe.

The official color codes for the flag are:

- Blue: Pantone 286 C / RGB 0, 51, 153
- Yellow: Pantone 116 C / RGB 255, 204, 0
- White: RGB 255, 255, 255

The flag was adopted in 1968 when Nauru gained independence from Australia.
