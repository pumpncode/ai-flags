The flag of Saint Pierre and Miquelon consists of a blue field with a yellow ship at the center, representing the historical importance of fishing and shipping to the islands. The ship is outlined in black and appears to be sailing on waves represented by three white wavy lines beneath it. The flag has an aspect ratio of 2:3, with dimensions of approximately 60 cm x 90 cm (24 in x 36 in). The color codes for the flag are:
