The Australian flag is comprised of three components: the Union Jack, the Commonwealth Star, and the Southern Cross constellation. The flag has a ratio of 1:2, and its dimensions are 1.5 meters by 0.75 meters. The Union Jack located in the upper left corner takes up one-fourth of the flag's area, while the remaining three-fourths is dark blue with the Commonwealth Star underneath it. The five white stars of the Southern Cross appear to the right of the Commonwealth Star. The colors used in the flag are:

- Dark Blue (#002A3A)
- Red (#FF0101)
- White (#FFFFFF)

There aren't any specific geometric properties or measurements for the various elements of the flag, but the dimensions and colors are standardized by the Australian National Flag Protocol.
