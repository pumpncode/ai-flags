The flag of the United States consists of 13 horizontal stripes alternating between red and white, with a blue rectangle in the upper left corner containing 50 white, five-pointed stars arranged in nine offset horizontal rows of six stars (top and bottom) alternating with rows of five stars.

The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:1.9, meaning that its width is 1 unit and its length is 1.9 units. The stripes are each equal in width and measure approximately 1.33 inches (3.4 cm) in height. The blue rectangle, also known as the canton, measures approximately 0.76 units in height and 1 unit in width. The stars are each 0.946 inches (2.4 cm) in diameter and are arranged in a grid pattern with a center-to-center distance of approximately 0.27 units.

The colors used on the flag are defined by the Pantone Matching System (PMS). The red stripes are PMS 193C, the blue rectangle is PMS 282C, and the white stripes and stars have no specific PMS color code as they are simply the natural color of the fabric used.

The flag is typically made of nylon or polyester and is required to be flown in accordance with the United States Flag Code, which outlines proper display and handling procedures.
