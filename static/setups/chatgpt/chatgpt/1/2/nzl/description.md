The flag of New Zealand features a dark blue background with the Union Jack in the top left corner and four five-pointed red stars outlined in white on the right half. The stars are arranged in the shape of the constellation Crux, also known as the Southern Cross. 

The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning that its width is half its length. The Union Jack is scaled down to one quarter the size of the flag's height, while each star has a diameter of approximately one seventh of the flag's width.

The color codes for the flag are:

- Blue: Pantone 280 C / RGB 0 33 71 / HEX #002157
- Red: Pantone 186 C / RGB 186 12 47 / HEX #BA0C2F
- White: Pantone White / RGB 255 255 255 / HEX #FFFFFF

The geometric properties of the flag are rectangular with straight sides and 90-degree angles at the corners.

The current flag of New Zealand has been in use since 1902, but there have been several proposals to change it in recent years.
