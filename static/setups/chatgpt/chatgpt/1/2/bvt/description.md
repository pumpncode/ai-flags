Bouvet Island, an uninhabited island located in the South Atlantic Ocean, does not have an official flag. As a territory of Norway, it is represented by the flag of Norway. The Norwegian flag features a red background with a blue Scandinavian cross outlined in white that extends to the edges of the flag. The aspect ratio of the flag is 8:11, and the geometric properties are those of a rectangle. 

The color codes for the Norwegian flag are:

- Red: Pantone 185 C / CMYK (0, 100, 81, 4) / RGB (196, 18, 48) / Hex #C41030
- Blue: Pantone 281 C / CMYK (100, 72, 0, 21) / RGB (0, 53, 118) / Hex #003576 
- White: no specific Pantone code, but it represents the absence of color

The measurements of the flag vary depending on its size, but the proportions remain constant. In general, the width of the flag is 8/17 of its length, and the vertical and horizontal arms of the cross are each 6/17 of the length of the flag.
