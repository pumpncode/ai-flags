The flag of the Falkland Islands consists of a dark blue field with the Union Jack in the upper left corner and the Falkland Islands coat of arms centered on the right half of the flag. The coat of arms features a sheep, a ship, and a ram representing the island's economic activity, maritime history, and wildlife respectively.

- Red: Pantone 186 C / RGB (213, 43, 30) / #D52B1E
- White: RGB (255, 255, 255) / #FFFFFF

The dimensions of the Falkland Islands flag depend on its intended use, but the recommended measurements for a standard size flag are approximately 1.8 meters wide by 3 meters long.
