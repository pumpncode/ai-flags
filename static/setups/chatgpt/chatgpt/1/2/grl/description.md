The flag of Greenland has a 2:3 aspect ratio and consists of two equal horizontal bands of white (top) and red (bottom), separated by a narrow vertical stripe of the same color. The red bands are Pantone 185C or RGB 213, 39, 43, while the white band is Pantone White or RGB 255, 255, 255. The center of the flag features a circle that is positioned closer to the hoist side and is slightly off-center. The circle is vertically divided into two halves: the left half is white and the right half is red. The diameter of the circle is three-tenths (3/10) of the flag's height.
