The flag of Argentina consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width, with the top and bottom stripes colored light blue (#75AADB) and the middle stripe white. The ratio of the height to the width of the flag is 2:3. The sun with a human face, known as the Sun of May, is situated in the center of the flag's white stripe. The sun has a diameter of two-fifths (2/5) of the height of the white stripe, and its rays alternate between 16 straight and wavy lines.

The flag's dimensions vary depending on its intended use, but the standard size for the national flag is 1.4 meters wide by 0.9 meters high. The sun is positioned at a distance from the hoist-side edge of the flag equal to one-half the height of the white stripe.
