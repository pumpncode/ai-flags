The flag of Croatia consists of three equal-sized horizontal stripes - the top one is red (#FF0000), the middle one is white (#FFFFFF), and the bottom one is blue (#0000FF). Its aspect ratio is 1:2, meaning its width is twice its height. The geometric properties are straightforward; it is a rectangle with the length being twice the height. There are no additional measurements or symbols on the flag.
