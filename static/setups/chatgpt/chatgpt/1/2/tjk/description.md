The flag of Tajikistan consists of three horizontal stripes: a broad white stripe in the center, flanked by narrower red stripes. In the center of the white stripe is a gold crown surmounted by seven stars. The ratio of the flag's height to its width is 2:3. The color codes for the flag are as follows: 
- White: #FFFFFF
- Red: #CF142B
- Gold: #FFC627

The height of the crown is equal to one-third of the total height of the white stripe, and its width is equal to half of the height. The seven stars above the crown are arranged in an arc, with one larger star in the center and six smaller stars surrounding it. The distance from the top of the crown to the bottom of the larger star is equal to one-eighth of the total height of the white stripe.
