The flag of Cayman Islands features a blue field with the Union Jack in the upper left corner, and the coat of arms centered on the right side. The coat of arms consists of a shield with three stars (representing the three islands of Grand Cayman, Little Cayman, and Cayman Brac) over a wavy line representing the sea. The shield is supported by a green turtle and a pineapple. The flag has a ratio of 1:2, and the colors used are:

- Blue: Pantone 286 C / RGB 0, 90, 156

- White: Pantone White / RGB 255, 255, 255
- Green: Pantone 356 C / RGB 0, 147, 69

The dimensions of the flag are not specified, but the coat of arms is typically positioned so that its center is at a distance of one-third of the hoist (width) of the flag from the right edge.
