The flag of Liechtenstein consists of two equal horizontal bands of blue (top) and red with a gold crown on the hoist side of the blue band. The aspect ratio is 3:5, and the exact color codes are not specified by law, but they are typically defined as Pantone 280 C for the blue and Pantone 186 C for the red. The height of the crown is 2/5 of the height of the flag, and it is centered within the blue band. The flag has no official geometric properties or measurements, but it is commonly seen in sizes ranging from 30 x 20 cm to 150 x 100 cm.
