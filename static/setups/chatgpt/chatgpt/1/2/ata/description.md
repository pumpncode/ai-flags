There is no official flag of Antarctica as it is not a sovereign state. However, the Antarctic Treaty System uses a symbol consisting of a map of Antarctica surrounded by five intersecting circles representing the five original signatory nations of the treaty: Argentina, Australia, Chile, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The colors used in this symbol are blue (Pantone 286C) and white, with black outlines. There is no specific aspect ratio, geometric properties or measurements associated with this symbol.
