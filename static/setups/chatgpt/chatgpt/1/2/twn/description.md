The national flag of Taiwan, also known as the Republic of China (ROC) flag, has a rectangular shape with an aspect ratio of 2:3. It consists of a red background with a navy blue canton bearing a white sun with 12 triangular rays. The width of the canton is one-third of the total width of the flag, and its top left corner is located at one-fifth of the total length of the flag from the hoist side.

The color codes for the flag are:

- Red: Pantone 186C / #FF0000
- Navy Blue: Pantone 286C / #000080
- White: #FFFFFF

The geometric properties and measurements of the flag are:

- Width to length ratio: 2:3
- Canton width: 1/3 of the width of the flag
- Canton's distance from the hoist side: 1/5 of the length of the flag
- Diameter of the sun: 3/8 of the height of the canton
- Length of each ray of the sun: 5/24 of the height of the canton

It's worth noting that the flag specifications were revised in 1928, 1947, and 1995, leading to minor adjustments in the flag's dimensions and color shades.
