The flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory consists of a blue field with six white wavy horizontal stripes across it. In the upper hoist-side quadrant, there is a palm tree above a yellow and red sun rising over the sea. The flag has no official aspect ratio, but its general proportions are roughly 1:2. The RGB color codes for the blue field are 0, 35, 149, while the white stripes are pure white (255, 255, 255), and the sun is gold (255, 215, 0) with a red (205, 32, 31) center.
