The colors are arranged diagonally with a blue five-pointed star in the center of the flag. The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning that its width is two-thirds of its length.

The geometric properties of the flag include a height of 1 unit and a width of 1.5 units. The blue star has a diameter of 1/3 units and is placed at the intersection of the diagonal lines formed by the white and red quarters. The color codes for the flag are:

This flag was officially adopted on December 20, 1903, after Panama declared independence from Colombia.
