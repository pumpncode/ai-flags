The national flag of Ireland, also known as the Irish tricolour, consists of three equal vertical stripes: green on the hoist side, white in the middle, and orange on the fly side. The dimensions of the flag are 1:2, meaning that the width is twice the height. The colors are defined in the Pantone Matching System (PMS) as follows: 
- Green: PMS 347
- White: no specific PMS designation
- Orange: PMS 151

There are no geometric properties or measurements specified for the flag itself, but it is typically flown in standard sizes ranging from small handheld flags to large ones that can be seen from a distance.
