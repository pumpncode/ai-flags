The aspect ratio is 2:3, and the height of each band is one-third of the total height of the flag. The color codes for the flag are:

The yellow star in the center has a diameter of one-fifth the height of the flag (or 12% of the total flag area). There are no official measurements for the flag's dimensions or the size of the star, but the flag is typically produced in sizes ranging from about 2 feet by 3 feet to 10 feet by 15 feet.
