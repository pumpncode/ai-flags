The current flag of New Zealand is a blue field with the Union Jack in the top left corner, and four red stars with white borders in a diagonal pattern on the right side. The stars represent the constellation of Crux, also known as the Southern Cross. The flag has an aspect ratio of 1:2, meaning it is twice as long as it is wide. The colors used are:
- Blue: Pantone 186C (RGB: 0, 48, 100)
- Red: Pantone 485C (RGB: 255, 21, 50)
- White: pure white (RGB: 255, 255, 255)

The height of each star is three-fifths of the fly width and their diameter is four-fifths of the height of the Union Jack. The Union Jack takes up one quarter of the total area of the flag, with the stars taking up the remaining three quarters.
