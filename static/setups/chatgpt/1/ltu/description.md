The flag of Lithuania has a ratio of 3:5 and consists of three horizontal stripes - yellow on top, green in the middle, and red at the bottom. The colors are defined in CIE L*a*b* color space as follows: Yellow (L*91.5, a*-5.5, b*86.9), Green (L*43.8, a*-51.1, b*49.0), and Red (L*47.7, a*70.2, b*50.9). The flag's geometric dimensions are not specified by law, but it is generally recommended that the height of the stripes should be equal to one-third of the total flag width.
