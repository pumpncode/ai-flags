The flag of Canada is a red field with a white square in the center. Inside the white square is a red stylized 11-pointed maple leaf. The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning that its width is twice its height. The exact measurements of the flag depend on its size, but the length of the sides of the white square is usually half of the flag's width. The official color codes for the flag are:

- Red: Pantone 032 C / CMYK 0-100-81-4 / RGB 255-0-0 / HEX #FF0000
- White: No specific Pantone code / CMYK 0-0-0-0 / RGB 255-255-255 / HEX #FFFFFF

The design of the flag was chosen through a national competition in 1965 and officially adopted on February 15, 1965.
