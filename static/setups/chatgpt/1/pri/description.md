The flag of Puerto Rico consists of five equal horizontal bands, with three red and two white. A blue equilateral triangle is located on the left-hand side of the flag, with a white five-pointed star in the center of the triangle. The ratio of the flag's width to its length is 2:3. The shade of red used is Pantone 186C, and the shade of blue used is Pantone 281C. The exact measurements of the triangle and star are not specified by law, but traditionally, the height of the equilateral triangle is equal to the width of the flag.
