The flag of Montserrat features a blue background with the Union Jack in the top left corner and the Montserrat coat of arms in the center. The coat of arms includes a woman holding a harp, representing Erin, the national personification of Ireland, and an Irish elk or Megaloceros giganteus, which is native to Ireland. The flag has an aspect ratio of 1:2, meaning it is twice as long as it is wide. The exact color codes are not specified by the government, but the blue field is typically described as "Montserrat blue," a shade of blue that is similar to the flag of the United Nations. Geometric properties and measurements are not officially specified, but the flag's dimensions should be proportional to the aspect ratio.
