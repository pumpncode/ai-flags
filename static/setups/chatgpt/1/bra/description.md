The Brazilian flag consists of a green field with a large yellow diamond in the center, inside which is a blue circle containing 27 white, five-pointed stars arranged in the pattern of the night sky over Rio de Janeiro as it appeared on November 15, 1889. The stars represent the country's 26 states and the Federal District. The green and yellow colors symbolize Brazil's forests and abundant natural resources, while the blue circle and stars convey the country's sky and aspirations toward progress.

The aspect ratio of the flag is 7:10, with the height being seven parts and the width being ten parts. The diamond shape in the middle has a height-to-width ratio of 2:3, and its longer diagonal measures 24 units, while its shorter diagonal measures 16 units. The circle has a radius of 3/10th of the diamond's longer diagonal, or approximately 3.67 units.
