The flag of Belize has a 2:3 aspect ratio and consists of a blue base with a white circle in the center. Inside the circle is an emblem depicting a mahogany tree, a shield with three sections featuring a paddle, a squaring block, and a saw, and underneath, the nation's motto "Sub Umbra Floreo" ("Under the Shade I Flourish"). The colors used on the flag are blue (Pantone 300C) and white. The diameter of the circle is two-thirds the height of the flag.
