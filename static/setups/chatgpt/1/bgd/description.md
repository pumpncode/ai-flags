The flag of Bangladesh consists of a rectangular shape with a length to width ratio of 10:6. It is divided into two equally sized panels, the upper panel being green (#006A4E) and the lower panel being red (#F42A41). A circular white disk with a red dot in the center of the flag represents the rising sun. The diameter of the circle is one-fifth of the width of the flag. The center point of the red dot is located at a distance of one-tenth of the width of the flag from the top edge, and also from the left edge of the flag.
