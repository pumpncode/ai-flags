The flag of Moldova consists of three equal vertical stripes, from left to right: blue, yellow, and red. The color codes are:
- Blue: Pantone 639C; RGB (0, 81, 186); CMYK (100, 60, 0, 27)
- Yellow: Pantone 109C; RGB (255, 213, 0); CMYK (0, 17, 100, 0)
- Red: Pantone 485C; RGB (206, 17, 38); CMYK (0, 100, 93, 19)

The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, which means that the height is twice the length. The geometric properties and measurements of the flag are as follows:
- The width of each stripe is one-third of the flag's width
- The center of the yellow stripe is positioned at the exact midpoint of the flag's length
- The distance between the edge of the flag and the closest stripe is one-sixth of the flag's width
- The coat of arms of Moldova is placed in the center of the flag, slightly overlapping the yellow stripe

Note: The coat of arms of Moldova features a stylized eagle holding an Orthodox Christian cross in its beak and a scepter in its talons, with a star above it and an olive branch and a rose below it.
