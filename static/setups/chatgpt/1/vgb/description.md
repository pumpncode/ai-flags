The flag of the British Virgin Islands consists of a blue base with the Union Jack in the top left corner, surrounded by 17 white-tipped green triangles arranged in a circle. The coat of arms of the British Virgin Islands is displayed in the center of the circle made up by the triangles.

The aspect ratio of the flag is 1:2, meaning the width is twice as long as the height. The geometric properties of the flag are that it is rectangular in shape, and the circle formed by the green triangles has a diameter equal to three-fifths (3/5) of the height of the flag.

The official color codes for the flag are:

- Blue: Pantone 286C
- Green: Pantone 355C
- White: N/A

The measurements of the flag are not specified in the law governing its design, but it is typically seen in sizes ranging from 3 feet by 5 feet (91 cm by 152 cm) to 5 feet by 8 feet (152 cm by 244 cm).
