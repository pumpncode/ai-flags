The flag of Ghana consists of three horizontal stripes - the top and bottom stripes are red and the middle stripe is golden yellow. In the center of the golden stripe, there is a black five-pointed star. The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning that it is twice as long as it is wide. The colors of the flag have specific Pantone color codes: Red 186C, Gold 116C, and Black. The geometric properties and measurements of the flag include a length of 1.5 times its width, with each stripe being one-third of the flag's height. The black star has a diameter of two-thirds of the width of the central gold stripe, and is positioned in the center of the stripe.
