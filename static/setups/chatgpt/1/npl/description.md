The flag of Nepal is non-quadrilateral and consists of two juxtaposed triangles, one pointing upwards and the other downwards. The upper triangle is colored crimson (Pantone 186C) and represents the sun and the lower triangle is blue (Pantone 286C) and represents the moon. The aspect ratio of the flag is 5:3, and the geometric properties of the triangles are such that each has a base of equal length to the height of the flag, and their union forms a shape resembling two overlaid pennants. The exact measurements of the flag vary depending on its size, but the ratio of the height of the flag to the width of the base of the lower triangle is always 10:9.
