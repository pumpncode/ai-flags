The flag of the Faroe Islands is a rectangular panel with a ratio of 5:9, divided diagonally from the lower hoist-side corner to the upper fly-side corner. The upper triangle is blue (Pantone 287C), and the lower triangle is red (Pantone 186C). The diagonal line that separates the two triangles is white and has a width of 1/10th of the flag's total height. The center point of the line is at a distance of 3/20th of the flag's length from the hoist side. The flag's measurements are not officially specified but are typically manufactured in sizes ranging from small handheld flags to large outdoor banners.
