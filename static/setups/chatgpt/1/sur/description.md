The flag of Suriname has a rectangular shape with an aspect ratio of 2:3. It is divided diagonally into two triangles, the top triangle is green (#007F4C) and the bottom triangle is red (#CE1126). The intersection point of the two triangles is a yellow five-pointed star outlined in black (#FCD116 and #000000). The center of the star is located at 3/8 of the hoist side of the flag (measured from the left edge). The width of the star is 1/5 of the length of the flag, and the distance between the points of the star and the nearest edges of the triangles is equal to 1/10 of the length of the flag.
