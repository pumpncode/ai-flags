The flag of Rwanda consists of three horizontal stripes of equal size, with the top and bottom stripes being sky blue and the middle stripe yellow. The blue stripes represent happiness and peace, while the yellow represents economic development. In the center of the flag is a black stylized image of a sun with 24 rays emanating from it.
