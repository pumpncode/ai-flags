The flag of Venezuela has a 2:3 aspect ratio and consists of three horizontal stripes of equal size. The top and bottom stripes are yellow, while the middle stripe is blue. In the center of the blue stripe, there are seven white five-pointed stars arranged in an arc with one larger star in the center. The official color codes for the Venezuelan flag are:

The geometric properties and measurements of the Venezuelan flag can vary depending on its size, but the dimensions of the central star are typically proportional to the width of the blue stripe. The distance between the centers of the two outer stars is also usually equal to the width of the blue stripe.
