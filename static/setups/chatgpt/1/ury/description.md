The flag of Uruguay consists of nine horizontal stripes, alternating white and blue. The top and bottom stripes are white and the middle stripe is twice the width of the others and golden-yellow. In the upper hoist corner, there is a golden-yellow sun with a human face consisting of 16 rays extending outward. 

The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning that the width is two-thirds of the height. The geometric properties of the flag are rectangular with a length of 270 units and a width of 180 units.

The official color codes for the flag are:
- Blue: Pantone 286 C / RGB: #0038A8
- White: Pantone White / RGB: #FFFFFF
- Golden-Yellow: Pantone 1235 C / RGB: #FCD116

The sun's diameter is equal to 1/2 of the height of the canton (the top left corner of the flag where the sun is located), and its face has a radius of 1/5 of the sun's diameter.
