The flag of Chile consists of two equal horizontal bands of white and red, with a blue square the same height as the white band in the canton. The blue square bears a white five-pointed star in the center. The aspect ratio of the flag is 2:3, meaning it is twice as wide as it is tall. The geometric properties include a rectangle shape with a length of 1.5 times its width. The color codes for the flag are:

- Red: Pantone 032 C / RGB (213, 43, 30) / HEX #D52B1E
- White: Pantone White / RGB (255, 255, 255) / HEX #FFFFFF
- Blue: Pantone 286 C / RGB (0, 83, 159) / HEX #00539F

The blue square in the canton takes up one-fourth of the flag's total area, while the white and red stripes each take up half. The star in the center of the blue square has a diameter of three-fifths the width of the square.
