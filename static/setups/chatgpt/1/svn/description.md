The flag of Slovenia consists of three horizontal stripes - white on the top, blue in the middle, and red on the bottom - with a proportional length-to-width ratio of 2:1. The colors are defined using Pantone codes: white (Pantone White), blue (Pantone 293C), and red (Pantone 186C). The coat of arms of Slovenia is located in the upper left corner of the flag, taking up one-third of the flag's width and centered vertically. The coat of arms features a shield with Mount Triglav, the highest peak in Slovenia, and two wavy lines representing the Adriatic Sea and local rivers. The measurements of the coat of arms are not specified in official sources.
