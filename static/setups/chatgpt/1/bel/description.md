The flag of Belgium consists of three equal vertical bands of black, yellow, and red. The official color codes for the stripes are:

- Black: #000000
- Yellow: #FEE12B
- Red: #ED2939

The aspect ratio of the flag is 13:15, meaning that its width is 13 units and its length is 15 units (or any multiple of those units). The geometric properties of the flag are simple: it is a rectangular shape with straight edges and right angles.

In terms of measurements, the flag's height is usually around 75% of its width, or about 3/5 of the total length. The exact dimensions can vary depending on the size of the flag.

The flag of Belgium does not have any other notable features beyond its three colored stripes.
